        "content": "Rolling out the Uniform Civil Code in Uttarakhand, Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Monday said that among the aims of the code – the first of its kind to be implemented in the country – was to ensure that cases like the murder of a woman in Delhi in 2022, allegedly by her live-in partner, do not take place again.\nDhami said the mandatory registration of live-in relationships under the UCC was not an “intrusion into the lives of live-in couples” but is meant to protect them.\n“Live-in relationships mein…sambandh kharab hone ke baad maar peet hui hai, hinsa ghatnayen hui hai. Bahut baar isme hatyayen bhi hui hain. Dilli ka 2022 ka case hua tha Shraddha Walkar aur Aaftab. Isme 300-litre ke fridge mein, Shraddha Walkar ko kaatke usko daal diya gaya tha.

Chief Secretary Radha Raturi said the law would ensure equal rights for “our sisters”.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBringing a UCC was among the BJP’s elections promises ahead of the 2022 Assembly polls in Uttarakhand, and helped bring the Pushkar Singh Dhami government to power in the state.\nDhami said that although it took three years to implement the UCC, the state government was able to fulfil the promise with the help of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “This is a constitutional solution to prevent discrimination in family laws on the grounds of religion and gender,” he said.\nThe chairperson of the committee that framed the rules for the UCC, Shatrughan Singh, said that Dr B R Ambedkar had advocated for such a law.\n“Discussion and debates had taken place in the Constituent Assembly on whether it (the UCC) should be included in the Fundamental Rights, but it was later included in the Directive Principles. The Supreme Court had also asked the executive to prepare UCC,” he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSingh said that before the framing of the draft for the Bill, “We went through the Law Commission’s reports on family laws, and read the Parliamentary Committees’ reports. Later, we approached the public for their recommendations.”\nOn privacy concerns, Singh said the rule-framing committee was mindful about the sharing of private information.\nSubscribe to receive the day's headlines from The Indian Express straight in your inbox\n“We have open access data and restricted data.

The data is available for couples who want to check details of each other, regarding former relationships and marriage registration. We will give them the date only only if they come jointly,” Singh said, adding, “We had recommended an alternative mechanism for reconciliation in disputes, but it has not been retained.”"

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/aap-arvind-kejriwal-middle-class-outreach-9802331/?ref=hometop_hp",
        "content": "Arvind Kerjriwal’s sudden outreach to the normally ignored middle class has taken many by surprise, particularly as his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has been geared to catering to Delhi’s poor, jhuggi-jhopri dwellers, and scooter-wallahs.\nIt is not as if the middle class has not supported Kejriwal. The tallies that the AAP scored in 2015 and 2020 — 67 MLAs and 62 MLAs, respectively — could not have been possible without the support of Delhi’s middle class. This time, his pitch to the middle class underscores a reality many have sensed: the middle class shows signs of fatigue with a government that has been in the saddle for 10 years even as the poorer sections swear by him and the line oft-repeated by many of them is “kaam toh kiya hai (he has done work)”.\nKejriwal is essentially a creature of the middle-class driven “India Against Corruption” movement of 2010-11 led by Anna Hazare that created the environment that sent the Manmohan Singh government packing in 2014. He made the successful transition from a movement to a political party, secured its national party status. and positioned it as the party of the poor.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPause\nUnmute\n:\nFullscreen\nIf the socio-economic survey undertaken by the Delhi government in 2018 is anything to go by, at best, 8% of the families in the National Capital spent between Rs 25,000 and Rs 50,000 per month and can be categorised as the middle class in Delhi. So, theoretically speaking, Kejriwal does not have to worry unduly about such a small number though private agencies believe that Delhi’s middle class is as big as 45% of the population of the megalopolis.\nSTORIES YOU MAY LIKE\nBigg Boss 18 winner Karanveer Mehra’s ex-wife Nidhi Seth gets married. See pics\nMamta Kulkarni says she ‘can’t imagine doing films again’ after taking sanyas at Maha Kumbh\nTracking SIM used by accused, Mumbai Police questions woman in village near Bangladesh border\nAAP supporters at a rally addressed by former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections scheduled for February 5. (Express photo by Tashi Tobgyal)\nA calculated move?\nKejriwal’s middle-class card appears to be calculated to achieve three things. Always quick to sense the direction of the wind, the AAP chief, who is fighting an existential battle this time, may realise that this not-so-large, though highly articulate and media-savvy section of society may have become disenchanted with his party and may seek a change on February 5. They are likely to look at the BJP as an alternative — it has been out of power in Delhi for more than a quarter century — than a struggling Congress that, at best, is likely to cut into the AAP’s votes.\nThe AAP chief may also worry that voter fatigue and an anti-incumbency of 12 years may also take its toll on some of the “underclasses” who have stayed by his side. For, a poor person who happily sends her child to a reformed government school also worries about the potholed roads she has to navigate or about the hacking cough she suffers from, breathing polluted air day after day, even as she goes to a mohalla clinic for free medical help. At the end of the day, the usually loud middle class does influence others around it.\nKejriwal is trying to keep his party as broad-based as possible. Significantly, his seven-point manifesto for the middle class is not a list of promises. They are demands he has put out, as if on behalf of the middle class, to the Narendra Modi government on issues that agitate them today and have led to their growing economic hardship.\nADVERTISEMENT\nEven if not a spokesperson for them, he is trying to demonstrate that he stands by their side as their well-wisher. His pitch is calculated to remind the middle class what the Modi government has not done for them. It comes as a warning, saying “beware” before you consider voting for the BJP.\nDelhi Assembly Elections 2025 | Modi for PM, Kejriwal for CM, indifference for ‘Sheesh Mahal’\nWhen Kejriwal recently spoke about the “tax terrorism’ the middle class has to put up with, or the GST they pay on goods for daily use, or called for 10% of the Union government’s budget to be used on education, and a fee cap in private schools, he was touching a raw nerve as the middle class knows huge concessions have been given to the rich and “revdis” to the poor. As the AAP chief put it evocatively in Hindi, the middle class “pees rahe hain (getting squeezed)”.\nComing before the presentation of the Union Budget on February 1, Kejriwal may also want to put Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on the spot. As it is, there has been a growing demand from certain sections that taxes — direct as well as GST slapped on essential items — be reduced to give relief to the middle class.\nMiddle class versus Mandal politics\nThe BJP’s narrative against “freebies” also plays on the middle-class angst that revdis for the poor are doled out at their expense.\nADVERTISEMENT\nNormally, political parties concentrate on the concerns of the poor and the backward who are larger in number, and Kejriwal is no exception. His promise of free electricity (up to 200 units) and water (up to 20,000 litres per household), government school reforms, access to free medicines at mohalla clinics, free bus tickets for women, and a promise of Rs 2,100 to women each month are all geared to reach out to the poorer sections, who remain his best bet.\nFor successive Prime Ministers and Chief Ministers, it has not been possible to win elections without the support of the poor. Indira Gandhi relied on the “garibi hatao (end poverty)“ slogan to win the 1971 election, V P Singh implemented the Mandal report to give reservation to the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in government jobs; and Narendra Modi used the word poor in his first speech as Prime Minister in 2014 and created a pro-poor safety net with his welfare measures.\nIt was Singh’s Mandal politics that led to a pushback from the middle class. The middle-class youth saw the doors closing on them and there were widespread protests. Whether it was Gandhians, Marxists, religious hardliners, or secularists, the middle class, largely synonymous with the upper castes, united in opposition to Mandal, which to them spelt shrinking opportunities.\nThey turned to the BJP for protection and support and the party withdrew support to the V P Singh government. The Mandir movement, or Hindutva, as a manifestation of Hindu nationalism, grew in the years that followed, with this aggrieved middle class becoming a mainstay of this upsurge. It was later when Modi, from an OBC group, took over, positioning himself as the “chaiwala” PM, that he roped in the poorer and backward sections to widen the BJP’s base.\nADVERTISEMENT\nKejriwal perhaps now senses the beginnings of a middle-class pushback nationally and is hoping to tap into this force not just for the imminent Delhi election but beyond it for his long-term goals.\n(Neerja Chowdhury, Contributing Editor, The Indian Express, has covered the last 11 Lok Sabha elections.

The entry of the actor, popularly known as ‘Bihari Babu’, is expected to spice up the contest for the Capital’s Purvanchali vote – estimated to be about one-third of the electorate. Sinha can go toe-to-toe with the BJP’s two most prominent Purvanchali campaigners, Manoj Tiwari and Ravi Kishen, who are also tinseltown faces from Bihar.\nSources said there is a possibility that another TMC MP known for his association with Bihar could campaign for the AAP.\nFor the Congress, Shatrughan Sinha campaigning for the AAP is particularly bitter as Rahul Gandhi himself had been instrumental in wooing the Bollywood actor away from the BJP after decades of his association with the party, just ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSinha was fielded by the Congress from the Patna Sahib seat, and lost. In 2022, he left the Congress to join the TMC.\nHaving staved off the BJP’s challenge in Bengal in successive elections, including recent Assembly bypolls, the TMC has started challenging the Congress’s position as the presumptive leader of INDIA. Several INDIA parties have backed TMC chief Mamata Banerjee for leadership of the alliance, including old Congress friend Lalu Prasad.\nTMC leaders point out that unlike Banerjee’s record against the BJP, the Congress has lost almost every one-on-one election against the BJP, and also question the Congress’s ability to rally other parties behind it.\nThe TMC’s decision to join the Delhi campaign is set to intensify the Congress’s isolation within the INDIA bloc. Another defeat for the Congress in Delhi, where it ruled for 15 straight years before losing power to the AAP, will open the Congress to further scrutiny.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn the other hand, having lent its hand and leaders to the AAP, the TMC can be sure of its backing in the INDIA leadership sweepstakes. The sense in the TMC is that NCP (SP) leader Sharad Pawar and Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray are also amenable to backing Banerjee, leaving the Congress with the support of only the DMK and the Left among major INDIA bloc constituents.\nIn voicing support for Banerjee, the RJD and Lalu have separately turned up the pressure on the Congress in Bihar, which goes for elections next. The RJD would prefer a weakened Congress that is in little position to flex its muscles during seat-sharing talks.\nSubscribe to Politically Speaking for an insider’s view from the power corridors\nIn the 2020 Assembly polls in Bihar, the Congress had indulged in much hard bargaining and secured as many as 70 seats, of which it could win only 19. On the other hand, the RJD, as part of the Mahagathbandhan with the Congress, had contested in 144 seats and won 75. Even the CPI(ML)(L) had a better record than the Congress in the alliance, winning 12 of the 19 seats it contested."

In a recent interaction, Fatima opened up about her early experiences in the industry, revealing how she faced the reality of the casting couch during the initial years of her career. She shared how unscrupulous casting directors took advantage of aspiring actors in Mumbai, often demanding a cut from their earnings.\nDuring a conversation on Bollywood Bubble, Fatima explained how every studio had its own auditions, which were often discovered through word-of-mouth among struggling actors. However, the casting director, who would be present at these studios, would ask actors to list their references on the audition forms. Later, when actors received payment for commercials or advertisements, they would find that a portion of their earnings had been taken by the same casting director. She recalled, “Even if we were at the audition through word-of-mouth, the casting director would ask us to write down our reference. That means you have to give 15 percent of your payment to them, despite not knowing them at all.”\nFatima clarified that reputable casting directors don’t engage in such practices. She added, “Known casting directors won’t do that; only fraud people would. Of course Mukesh Chhabra and Anmol Ahuja don’t do that.

        "content": "Despite being one of Bollywood’s most beloved power couples, Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna have openly acknowledged that they have more differences than similarities. Akshay once joked that apart from their shared habits of sleeping early, waking up early and enjoying games like Rummy and Ludo, they have little in common. “She thinks left, I think right,” he remarked in an interview last year. Recently, Twinkle revealed that she is frequently questioned about — and often blamed for — their differing political views. She pointed out that those who raise such concerns, however, never stop for a moment to think and understand that they are both independent individuals, capable of having their own ideologies.\nIn her recent column for The Times of India, Twinkle, also known by her pen name “Mrs Funnybones”, took a sharp jab at such people by questioning whether people believe Akshay is a child who would follow her instructions if she told him, “Beta ji, please walk on the left side of the road, and I will give you a Frooti.”\nYou have exhausted your monthly limit of free stories.\nRegister to read more stories\nSign up\nAlready have an account?

        "content": "Sending a clear political signal to the Congress, West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee has decided to depute MP and actor Shatrughan Sinha to campaign for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi.\nSources said that the Samajwadi Party, another key member of the INDIA bloc, too could send some of its MPs or leaders to campaign for the AAP.\nThe move reflects the deepening chasm between the Congress and INDIA parties, with many of them throwing their weight behind Arvind Kejriwal in the AAP’s bitter and high-octane contest against the BJP as well as the Congress in Delhi.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPause\nUnmute\n:\nFullscreen\nApart from the TMC and SP, the Congress’s Maharashtra allies Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP (SP) have also thrown their weight behind the AAP, with the Kejriwal-led party seen to be in a far better position to defeat the BJP than the Congress in Delhi.\nSTORIES YOU MAY LIKE\nWhy ajwain is the nutrition powerhouse you need for weight loss\nTracking SIM used by accused, Mumbai Police questions woman in village near Bangladesh border\nDoctor kidnapped in Karnataka for Rs 6-crore ransom, let off with Rs 300 to return home\nSinha, the TMC’s Asansol MP, will address rallies for top AAP leaders, including Kejriwal (New Delhi seat), AAP incumbent Chief Minister Atishi (Kalkaji) and former Deputy CM Manish Sisodia (Jungpura). The entry of the actor, popularly known as ‘Bihari Babu’, is expected to spice up the contest for the Capital’s Purvanchali vote – estimated to be about one-third of the electorate. Sinha can go toe-to-toe with the BJP’s two most prominent Purvanchali campaigners, Manoj Tiwari and Ravi Kishen, who are also tinseltown faces from Bihar.\nSources said there is a possibility that another TMC MP known for his association with Bihar could campaign for the AAP.\nFor the Congress, Shatrughan Sinha campaigning for the AAP is particularly bitter as Rahul Gandhi himself had been instrumental in wooing the Bollywood actor away from the BJP after decades of his association with the party, just ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSinha was fielded by the Congress from the Patna Sahib seat, and lost. In 2022, he left the Congress to join the TMC.\nHaving staved off the BJP’s challenge in Bengal in successive elections, including recent Assembly bypolls, the TMC has started challenging the Congress’s position as the presumptive leader of INDIA. Several INDIA parties have backed TMC chief Mamata Banerjee for leadership of the alliance, including old Congress friend Lalu Prasad.\nTMC leaders point out that unlike Banerjee’s record against the BJP, the Congress has lost almost every one-on-one election against the BJP, and also question the Congress’s ability to rally other parties behind it.\nThe TMC’s decision to join the Delhi campaign is set to intensify the Congress’s isolation within the INDIA bloc. Another defeat for the Congress in Delhi, where it ruled for 15 straight years before losing power to the AAP, will open the Congress to further scrutiny.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn the other hand, having lent its hand and leaders to the AAP, the TMC can be sure of its backing in the INDIA leadership sweepstakes. The sense in the TMC is that NCP (SP) leader Sharad Pawar and Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray are also amenable to backing Banerjee, leaving the Congress with the support of only the DMK and the Left among major INDIA bloc constituents.\nIn voicing support for Banerjee, the RJD and Lalu have separately turned up the pressure on the Congress in Bihar, which goes for elections next. The RJD would prefer a weakened Congress that is in little position to flex its muscles during seat-sharing talks.\nSubscribe to Politically Speaking for an insider’s view from the power corridors\nIn the 2020 Assembly polls in Bihar, the Congress had indulged in much hard bargaining and secured as many as 70 seats, of which it could win only 19. On the other hand, the RJD, as part of the Mahagathbandhan with the Congress, had contested in 144 seats and won 75. Even the CPI(ML)(L) had a better record than the Congress in the alliance, winning 12 of the 19 seats it contested."
