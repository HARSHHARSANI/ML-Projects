        "content": "The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is conducting raids at 15 premises, including that of businessman and Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty’s husband Raj Kundra, besides various other places in Mumbai and Uttar Pradesh in connection with the pornography case against Kundra.\nSources in the agency said the places being searched include Kundra’s residence in Juhu and premises linked to hisassociates.\nIn May 2022, the central agency registered a money laundering case against Raj Kundra in connection with the pornography case. The case was registered based on an FIR against him by the Mumbai police in 2021 for allegedly running a pornography racket. Kundra had been arrested by the Mumbai police in this connection. The ED is probing the financial transactions pertaining to the case.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe police made the first arrests in the alleged porn racket case in February 2021. Prior to this, the Mumbai Police Crime Branch conducted raids at a bungalow in Madh Island where porn movies were allegedly being shot.\nKundra was arrested in July 2021 after investigations revealed that he was a key conspirator in the case. The pornographic content produced was being distributed over subscription-based mobile apps like HotHit Movies and Hotshots.\nThe Hotshots app was developed by Armsprime Media Private Limited, a firm founded by Kundra in 2019. Armsprime later sold Hotshots to Kenrin Limited, a UK-based firm owned by Kundra’s brother-in-law Pradeep Bakshi.\nThe Mumbai police have already filed a chargesheet against Kundra and three other accused linked to the case. In 2021, Kundra spent two months in Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail and was granted bail in September that year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe ED is looking into significant overseas transactions in this connection. The agency is already investigating a money laundering case against Kundra over a Bitcoin scheme.\nIn April this year, the agency provisionally attached immovable and movable properties worth Rs 97.79 crore belonging to Kundra, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the Bitcoin investment fraud case.\nThe central agency said the attached properties include a residential flat in Mumbai’s upscale Juhu area, which is currently in the name of Shilpa Shetty, a residential bungalow situated in Pune, and equity shares in Kundra’s name.\nThe ED filed the Bitcoin money laundering case against Kundra based on multiple FIRs registered by the police forces in Maharashtra and Delhi against Variable Tech Pvt Ltd, Amit Bhardwaj (deceased), Ajay Bhardwaj, Vivek Bhardwaj, Simpy Bhardwaj, Mahender Bhardwaj, and several multiple-level marketing (MLM) agents.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe FIRs alleged the accused had collected huge funds in the form of Bitcoins – reportedly worth Rs 6,600 crore in 2017 — from people with false promises of a 10 per cent monthly return in the form of Bitcoins. “The collected Bitcoins were supposed to be utilised for Bitcoin mining and investors were supposed to get huge returns in crypto assets. But the promoters cheated the investors and have been concealing the ill-gotten Bitcoins in obscure online wallets,” the ED had stated.\nIn November 2023, Kundra made a movie ‘Undertrial 69 aka UT 69′ based on his days in prison, playing the central role himself."

        "content": "When 58-year-old Leelavati received a message from Khoda police station in Ghaziabad on Tuesday, telling her they had found her son, she wasn’t too excited.\nOver the last 31 years, she has received over seven such calls from the police, only to return disappointed. Her son Bhim Singh was nine, she says, when he was kidnapped in broad daylight. “I thought it would be a repeat of what happened many times earlier,’’ she recalls. “The police will bring a man in front of me and ask me to identify if he is my son. Every time they called me, I told them (policemen) about the marks on my son’s body. The marks never matched and I would return disappointed.”\nHowever, a small spark of hope remained. “I hardly had any hope of reuniting with my missing son… but then I kept telling myself, ‘what if they had found him?,’’ she says. “I had to go.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nInside Khoda police station, Leelavati covered her head with her blue saree as soon as a man appeared. “He looked at me and shouted… this is my mother,’’ she recalls.\n“I was a bit surprised and didn’t believe him. But when he called me mother again, I was moved to tears,’’ she says. There was another surprise for her though. She gave the policemen details of the marks on her missing son’s body and when they checked, her description matched. “He was indeed my son”.\nBhim is now a grown man. He is 40.\nThe tragic tale of this family, staying in a single-room house on the terrace of a two-storeyed building in Gali no. 6 of Ghaziabad’s Shaheed Nagar, began on September 8, 1993. Bhim, then around 9 years old, was returning from DBS Public school along with his two older sisters, Rajo and Santosh.\nBhim remembers that day vividly. “I remember asking my sister, Rajo, to buy me an umbrella while we were on our way back home. She didn’t want to and we were arguing,’’ he recalls. “Suddenly, a few men encircled me. They picked me up, pushed me into an auto (rickshaw) and drove away”.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFor Santosh (45) and Rajo (43), that moment is etched in their memory. “He was wearing a white shirt and light blue trousers. We were minutes away from our home, when a group of unknown men took him away,” recalls Santosh.\nAt that time, Rajo and Santosh were 14 and 12 years old respectively. Bhim also had a younger sister, Hema, who was less than a year old at the time. The sisters say they ran back to their home and informed their mother.\n“Their eyes were red. They were shivering and all they said was some people had taken Bhim in an auto. I ran barefoot to the spot. Their father was not home. I kept looking for him the entire day,” recalls Leelavati. “It was an unending trauma… we kept looking for him.”\nAfter 31 years, two months and 19 days, the family was miraculously reunited.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The last time I went to the police station three years ago. That time too my son wasn’t there. But I never lost hope. I knew he would find us one day,” says Leelavati\nWhile Bhim was missing, a lot changed — both his grandparents died, two of his sister got married. “My in-laws had left to go back to their village, Baidpura in Dadri, a year after he was kidnapped. His grandfather died 10 years ago and three years later his grandmother also died,” says Leelavati. “Two of his sisters are already married. We have become old now.”\nIt was Bhim’s younger sister Hema who saw a picture resembling her elder brother in a local daily on September 22. “It was an article about a man who had been missing for a long time and the police were searching for his family to reunite them,’’ Hema says. A relative, who works as a constable in the Ghaziabad Police, asked the family to visit the police station.\nAt Khoda police station –Bhim had already been taken to six different police stations before this — he also recognised his sisters the moment he saw them.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Besides, he had a mole on his right leg, a mark on left ear, a cut mark on his forehead and his hollow shaped head,” Leelavati says.\nBhim’s father, 70-year-old Tularam, however, wants to convince himself further. “We know he is our son. But we will get the DNA test done after December 6 to be sure about it,” he says.\nThe Ghaziabad police had been approaching the family because Bhim’s father had filed a missing person complaint at Mohan Nagar police station on September 9, 1993, a day after the boy was kidnapped. This case was unresolved.\nTwo days after Bhim was kidnapped, the family says, they had received a ransom letter. “We got a letter and his kidnappers demanded Rs 8 lakhs to set him free,” Tula Ram says.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile the family was frantically looking for him, Bhim says his nightmare began the moment he was kidnapped. “After taking me away in the auto, the kidnappers subsequently put me in a truck and drove away,’’ he says. The kidnappers, he says, had taken him to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan. “Before I could do anything, they chained me outside a hut of a herder,’’ he recalls. “They would make me rear sheep and cows…. milk them… during the day but they would keep me chained at night so that I couldn’t run away”.\nWhen asked if he ever made any attempts to run away, Bhim says he couldn’t.\n“I did not know where to go. For 30 to 40 km around the place, I knew there was no road. People travelled in camel carts. How far could I go on foot?” he says.\nBhim says that his “owner” was a man named Sai Ram who “kept an eye on me all the time”.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Once, a sheep had become so weak that it was not able to stand and died. They beat me badly.. they broke my right hand. My jaw got dislocated, I was scared of them,” he says.\nHow did he escape?\n“A few days ago, I met a truck driver while I was grazing sheep in the afternoon in Jaisalmer,” he says. “I narrated my entire story to him. He rescued me. He wrote all the information that I remembered on a piece of paper. This finally helped me reach Ghaziabad,’’ Bhim recalls. This note mentioned his name, his father’s name and that he is from somewhere in Ghaziabad.\n“The driver dropped me off at a market somewhere in Delhi. From there, with the help of people, I reached Indirapuram Police station in Ghaziabad,” Bhim says.\nHe says that initially he cried a lot. “But now my tears have dried up. I can’t cry anymore.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe says that he always missed his sisters while living in that desert far away. ”We would always play together in the house. I used to hate the fact that Happo would always get more milk to drink,” he smiles.\nBhim had given his own nickname, Happo, to his younger sister Hema – then just a newly born.\nThe sisters say while Bhim was missing, every Raksha Bandhan they would tie a Rakhi to his photo, which was clicked when Bhim was 6 years old.\nBhim, the Ghaziabad Police says, was rescued by a truck driver. “He found him somewhere in Jaisalmer. Bhim narrated the entire incident to the truck driver. This truck driver wrote his information on a paper and helped him reach the police,” Deputy Commissioner of Police, Ghaziabad, Nimish Patil says.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBhim had reached Ghaziabad on November 22. For the next five days, he was taken to several police stations where families of missing children came to check. He had met three other families earlier but had categorically said they are not his family.\n“It is a miracle,’’ Bhim’s father Tularam says. “We are going to teach him to use a mobile phone first and ask him to continue his education. He was in class three then, now he will start studying again.”"

        "content": "The historic nature of Maharashtra’s Assembly results might be more visible if we set aside the dramatic numbers and surprising turn-around from the Lok Sabha outcome. No doubt, the numbers are daunting — winning 132 seats out of the less than 150 contested, or pushing the rivals 14 percentage points backward, are no mean feats. But let us look at the major shifts this result will bring about.\nIf one starts tracing the history of how Congress lost control over states, Maharashtra will be one of the last ones. Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka came out of Congress dominance in the early 1980s. At that time, Congress in Maharashtra was still in the saddle, though the dominance had almost become dilapidated by then. The party went on to win 1985 handsomely and 1990 with hiccups. In a sense, this state was “the last fortress of Congress dominance” (to borrow the title of a book by Palshikar and Rajeshwari Deshpande, 2020).\nSubscribe to read on\nSelect your plan\nBEST VALUE\nAll-Access\nAd-lite experience\nAccess to premium stories\nAccess to ePaper\nSubscribe for ₹3.5/day\nDigital Only\nAd-lite experience\nAccess to premium stories\nAccess to ePaper\nSubscribe for ₹2.5/day\nAlready a subscriber?

        "content": "A large jewellery exhibition in Mumbai becomes the site of a heist. A hysterical phone call raises alarm, gunfire is heard, the cops on duty herd the panicked gathering into a secluded area, and during the melee, a fistful of precious gems go missing.\nChief investigator Jaswinder Singh (Jimmy Shergill) zeroes in on three suspects. Long-time employee at a jewellery store Mangesh Desai (Mehta), his pretty colleague Kamini (Tamannaah Bhatia), and computer techie Sikandar Sharma (Avinash Tiwary) who is in a tearing hurry to leave the grounds once the all-clear is sounded. The more Jaswinder hounds them, the more they stick to their stand of having nothing to do with the robbery. Do they protest too much? Or are they truly innocent, proving Jaswinder with his vaunted ‘instinct’ wrong, marring his blameless record for catching every single thief he has encountered?\nAlso read – Crew movie review: Kareena Kapoor, Tabu, Kriti Sanon’s easy-breezy comedy washes away stench of recent Bollywood duds\nADVERTISEMENT\nNeeraj Pandey has pulled off quite a heist with his new film in which he shares writing credits with Vipul K Rawal. The ‘heeron ki chori’ is just a lead-in to a film which is more pulpy character study than out-and-out thriller, a rare beast in Bollywood. The two-hour plus duration is dotted with twists and turns you don’t see coming, even as the whodunit-howdunit suspense keeps simmering: there are things I did twig on to, but the surprises kept coming, making things enjoyable.\nThat said, there are contrivances and plot-holes aplenty, and a few characters aren’t developed as much as they should have, but given the genre, you are willing to take them in your stride. Because the moment you are ripe for an eye-roll, something unexpected happens, and your attention is diverted, which is exactly what the filmmakers want.\nThe film swings through a fifteen year arc, from 2009 when the heist occurred, to the present when the mystery is sought to be unravelled through a series of flashbacks. How an event such as this can impact lives, and take them into unanticipated directions is woven through the telling, and the characters look and feel older, just as they should, even though some of the make-up looks plastered on.\nThe ensemble is the key to keep us watching. Jaswinder’s career has taken a dive, but his obsessive beliefs remain unshaken, a trait that has seen him part ways with his partner (Dutta, in a small role, leaves a big impact), and Shergill plays his character with the right degree of worn conviction. Tamannaah Bhatia proves that she doesn’t need only dance numbers in horror comedies to get eyeballs: she can be ‘stree’ enough. For a change, Rajeev Mehta gets more than just a forgettable role on the side. And Avinash Tiwary, flying high on his successful re-release of ‘Laila Majnu’, is, as ever, a delight.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRead more – Chor Nikal Ke Bhaaga movie review: There’s a lot going on in Yami Gautam, Sunny Kaushal film\nBeing on OTT means you can junk big stars in the pursuit of good story-telling. Or that’s what it was supposed to mean, before the streamers also got sucked into vacuous starry propositions with zero results. ‘Sikandar Ka Muqadaar’, its title riffing off on one of Amitabh Bachchan’s late 70s blockbusters, is a solid example of how you can get a film going on the strength of plot and performance, with stars servicing the story, just the way it should be.\nSikandar Ka Muqaddar\nDirector – Neeraj Pandey\nCast – Avinash Tiwary, Jimmy Shergill, Tamannaah Bhatia, Rajeev Mehta, Ridhima Pandit, Divya Dutta, Ashrut Jain\nRating – 3/5"

        "content": "The Telangana IAS Officers’ Institute and the Telangana IPS Officers’ Association have condemned remarks made by Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS) working president and MLA from Sircilla, K T Rama Rao, against Rajanna Sircilla District Collector Sandeep Kumar Jha.\nOn November 26, Rao had accused the District Collector of behaving like a Congress worker and urging BRS activists to join Congress.\n“The District Collector is working as a Congress party worker. Don’t be afraid of such people. Even Chief Minister Revanth Reddy cannot do anything to BRS. District Collectors and other officers who are working as Congress activists would be taught a good lesson when BRS returns to power,” Rao had said while addressing party workers in his home constituency.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“It is disturbing to note that it is becoming a norm to cast aspersions on public servants by persons occupying responsible public offices,” the IAS Officers’ Institute said in a statement.\nThe Telangana IAS Officers’ Association also expressed “deep concern and strong condemnation regarding the recent derogatory statement” by Rao.\n“In an unfortunate public remark, the collector was personally targeted and belittled in a manner that undermines the dignity of the officer holding such an important position in the state’s administration and Civil Services at large. We demand that such statements are retracted and an apology for the unwarranted remarks made,” the statement said.\nThe Association said that Rao’s comments questioned Jha’s integrity and impartiality. “The Association calls for immediate cessation of such unfounded accusations and urges all stakeholders to engage in discourse that respects institutional integrity and the rule of law,” it said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nKTR, who was a minister when the BRS was in power, has had several run-ins with the ruling Congress since the latter stormed to power in November 2023.\nEarlier this month, Rao alleged that Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy’s brother-in-law was awarded contracts worth over Rs 1,000 crore under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) despite his company lacking the necessary qualifications."

        "content": "The Congress on Friday raised with the Election Commission “serious and grave inconsistencies” which it said were being revealed in the data relating to the polling and counting processes for the recently-concluded Maharashtra Assembly polls and sought an in-person hearing to present relevant evidence.\nIn a memorandum to the poll panel, AICC Maharashtra in-charge Ramesh Chennithala, Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole and AICC general secretary Mukul Wasnik said “these glaring inconsistencies” which strike at the very root of a transparent, free and fair electoral system are not based on any biased motives or far-fetched presumptions but have been extracted from the information made publicly available by the Commission.\nSharing the memorandum on X, Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said the leaders have raised serious issues which are being discussed in the public domain. They have asked the Election Commission (EC) for an in-person hearing to present the relevant evidence and raise constituency-wise issues as well, he said.\nHere is a memorandum just submitted to @ECISVEEP on the Maharashtra assembly elections by Shri @NANA_PATOLE, Shri @MukulWasnik, and Shri Ramesh @chennithala\nThey have raised serious issues which are being discussed in the public domain. They have asked the EC for an in-person… pic.twitter.com/K4zfx5tjhF\n— Jairam Ramesh (@Jairam_Ramesh) November 29, 2024\nIn their memorandum, the Congress leaders said, “In fact, questions relating to Maharashtra’s voter data have also been raised by a former Chief Election Commissioner, hence we are bringing the same to the attention of this Commission.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThey flagged two issues of arbitrary deletion of voters and subsequent addition of over 10,000 voters in each constituency from the final voter lists as well as inexplicable increase in voting percentages from 5 pm to the final voter percentage declared by the Commission at 11:30 pm on the day of polling on November 20.\n“In the days leading upto the polling day, the Indian National Congress (INC) and its allies received several on ground-level reports about different means being adopted by the ruling regime to commit large scale electoral fraud across the Assembly Constituencies in Maharashtra,” the memorandum said.\n“With this exercise of unchecked and arbitrary deletion and consequent insertion of voters, the state of Maharashtra witnessed an unprecedented increase of an estimated 47 lakh voters being added to the electoral roll from between July 2024 — November 2024,” the memorandum said.\nIt is significant to note that out of the 50 Assembly constituencies where there was an average increase of 50,000 voters, the ruling regime and its allies secured victory from 47 of these constituencies, the leaders argued.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“These data points on a prima facie reading, demonstrates that — there has been a significant and inexplicable increase in the number of registered voters across the state of Maharashtra; and there has been an exercise of deletion and addition of names in voters lists; all of which have conveniently worked to the advantage of the incumbent government,” the memorandum said.\nThis issue was duly raised by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance on October 19 before this Commission, he said.\n“However, no cogent action was taken by this Commission on the Representation dated 19.10.2024 submitted by the MVA Alliance in this regard,” the memorandum said.\nThey urged the Commission to immediately undertake a thorough investigation and prepare a detailed report on the addition and deletion of voters in Maharashtra.\nElaborating on the other issue, the Congress leaders said several glaring discrepancies have been reported in the voter turn out data for the Maharashtra Assembly elections.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPointing out that as per the data made available by this Commission, the polling percentage across the state of Maharashtra at 5 pm was 58.22%, they said the percentage was later reported to be 65.02% as of 11:30 pm on the same day.\nIn fact, it is pertinent to place reliance on the statements by former Chief Election Commissioner of India SY Qureshi, who has gone on record to state that the voter data that is made available on the date of polling is recorded and updated in real time, therefore, there is no logical explanation of what has transpired in Maharashtra, the Congress leaders said.\nThe manner in which genuine doubts have arisen in the minds of the electorate regarding the conduct of free and fair elections, it is imperative that this Commission provides a clear response justifying the inconsistencies and the discrepancies which have been reported both prior to the elections and post elections, they said.\n“We would also request that this Commission grant us an urgent in-person hearing to raise all our issues in detail. In fact, apart from the two issues mentioned herein, there are several other constituency specific issues which we would like to raise before this Commission,” the Congress leaders said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe BJP-led Mahayuti alliance scripted a powerful comeback in the state assembly elections by winning 230 seats in the 288-member House.\nRecovering from its Lok Sabha elections losses, the BJP bagged 132 constituencies, the highest among all constituents of the Mahayuti. Shinde’s Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar’s NCP also performed well. The Shiv Sena won 57 seats while the NCP won 41 seats.\nThe Congress-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) suffered a setback. The grand old party registered one of its worst performances in the state assembly polls after it won only 16 seats. Sharad Pawar’s NCP(SP) won just 10 seats, whereas Uddhav Thackeray’s (UBT) won 20 seats"

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/jnu-sexual-harassment-complaints-data-reveals-9697130/?ref=latestnews_hp",
        "content": "Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) has recorded 151 sexual harassment complaints since 2017, the year its Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) replaced Gender Sensitisation Committee Against Harassment (GSCASH), according to data obtained through an RTI application.\nThe university claims to have resolved nearly 98 per cent of these complaints, with only three cases currently under investigation.\nHowever, when asked about the nature of the complaints and the action taken against the accused, JNU refused to provide information, citing confidentiality.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe decision to dismantle GSCASH in 2017 has been a contentious issue, with the JNU Students’ Union and Teachers’ Association consistently demanding its reinstatement.\nThe association argue that the ICC lacks the transparency and autonomy that GSCASH provided and operates under administrative influence, undermining trust in its processes.\nThe data shows that the highest number of cases in a single year was reported in 2018-19, with 63 complaints. Before the ICC’s formation, JNU had received 38 record cases in 2016.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic years saw a significant drop, with only six complaints registered between 2019 and 2021, likely due to reduced campus activity.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, the numbers surged in recent years, with 30 complaints each in 2022-23 and 2023-24.\nSeventeen cases were registered in 2017-18, 63 in 2018-19, five in 2019-20, one in 2020-21 and five in 2021-22, the data showed.\nIn 2015, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) noted that JNU had the highest number of sexual harassment complaints among the city’s educational institutions with 51 cases reported in a span of three years between 2013 and 2015. It amounted to approximately 50 per cent of such complaints among Delhi’s educational institutions during that period.\nRecently, several cases have brought JNU under intense scrutiny.\nIn April, a second year female student staged an indefinite strike for 12 consecutive days on campus blocking the main entrance point of the varsity after alleged ‘inaction’ over her ‘sexual harassment’ complaint to the university officials. The survivor and the supporters were later penalised by the varsity for staging the protest.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn October, as many as 47 female students filed a joint complaint with the ICC regarding alleged sexual harassment and violence that occurred during a freshers’ party on campus.\nSimilarly, in April, JNUSU claimed a female student of Centre for Chinese and South-East Asian Studies at the varsity was sexually harassed by her professor and inaction by the varsity administration over her complaint forced her to leave the campus.\nThe incidents have led to widespread protests and raised questions about the handling of complaints by the ICC."

I think he does that instinctively, and it’s not a long run-up, but I can see he’s reviewed that ball, and then he’s planning the next one.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nGlenn Maxwell ha rated Jasprit Bumrah as the complete package as a bowler. (Reuters)\nRecalling Bumrah’s slower ball to Shaun Marsh at the cusp of Lunch Break in Melbourne Test during the 2018-19 Border-Gavaskar Trophy,” Fleming said: “There’s that famous dismissal of Shaun Marsh at the MCG in 2018]in the over before lunch. I was commentating at the time, and I could almost pick what was going to happen, just driving him back, so his weight’s on the back foot, and then he bowls that superb slower ball and knocks him over.\n“It was either going to be that slower ball or a fast yorker. So I think he is so astute, but he also now has all the skills—outswingers, inswingers, off-cutters, slower balls, excellent yorker, bouncer.\nICC Latest Test Ranking: Jasprit Bumrah has regained the No. 1 spot in the ICC Test bowling rankings after spearheading his team to a record 295-run win over Australia. (AP)\n“So when you’ve got more skills, you’ve got more options. Like the Terminator, he’s always stalking the batsmen. And the batsmen know that, but they’re still unsure what’s coming. Not only does he have a wide skill set, but he executes it better than anyone in world cricket.”\nIndia will take on Australia in the Pink-ball Test in Adelaide starting December 6."

        "content": "Does Thursday’s Durban mania elevate Marco Jansen’s pedigree in the international bowling space as a menacing, unplayable beast when at his best?\nAll-time batting lows have been the flavour of late in Test cricket. Sri Lanka’s precipitous collapse for 42 all out at Kingsmead also impressed that Jansen can be as good a rhythm bowler as any, even if he may not have channelled the consistency factor yet. The 6-foot-9 left-armer’s 7-for may have passed on memories of Mohammed Siraj’s Lanka dahan last year.\nJansen, though, is getting steadier even if his latest haul might not be his most skilful work. The seven-wicket sequence comprising three bowled, one caught-and-bowled, and one caught at first, second and third slip each, would rank as a significant numerical hallmark. It also prompted Jansen’s compatriot Rassie van der Dussen, who last played a Test in 2022, to write on social media: “South Africa is the toughest place to bat in Test cricket. Change my mind.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nSouth Africa’s Marco Jansen leaves the field as he holds the ball after taking seven wickets during the second day of the first Test cricket match between South Africa and Sri Lanka, at Kingsmead stadium in Durban, South Africa, Thursday, Nov. 28, 2024. (AP Photo/Themba Hadebe)\nFast 7\nJansen’s incredible burst packed Sri Lanka for 42 in only 13.5 overs (83 balls), making it the second shortest completed Test innings in history and the lowest in 100 years since South Africa’s capitulation in England in June 1924 (30 all out in 7.5 overs).\nThe innings also marked the fourth sub-50 total for visiting teams in South Africa, the most for any country in the 21st century. Jansen picked up his first off his eighth delivery. 33 balls later, he was leading his side off the field with the best figures (7/13) by a South African pacer this century.\nSouth Africa’s Marco Jansen, left, celebrates with teammates after Sri Lanka’s Pathum Nissanka’s out for 3 runs during the second day of the first Test cricket match between South Africa and Sri Lanka, at Kingsmead stadium in Durban, South Africa, (AP)\nJansen’s spell was the joint-quickest in deliveries to reach seven wickets by a bowler in an innings, matching Hugh Trumble’s 41-ball 7-fer for Australia in the Ashes in 1904. He may not have dismayed the opposition quite like Curtly Ambrose during his famous 7/1 sequence in Perth (he was 0/24 before scalping his first wicket), but Jansen’s 7/9 (excluding extras) will also rank among the best Test bowling sequences for anyone who’s picked as many in an innings. Fourth-best by a pacer, in fact, and the fastest since Ambrose’s WACA massacre in February 1993.\nBest recorded 7-wicket Test sequences by pacers\n7/9 – (25 balls) Monty Noble 7/17 – Aus v Eng, 1901/02\n7/2 – (28 balls): George Lohmann 8/7 – Eng v SA, 1895/96\n7/1 – (30 balls) Sarfraz Nawaz 9/86 – Pak v Aus, 1978/79*\n7/1 – (32 balls): Curtly Ambrose 7/25 -WI v Aus, 1992/93\n7/9 – (33 balls): Marco Jansen 7/13 – SA v SL, 2024*\n• – excluding wide, no-balls\nLevelling up with Steyn, Rabada\nWhile consistency can almost instantly pull Jansen to the top seam-bowling bracket today, his fledgling career is far from middling, jostling between good and great. The 24-year-old went past 50 wickets with the seven-for in his 23rd innings, moving up to 56 scalps with a 20.17 average. That puts him on par with South Africa’s four-best pacers this century. His teammate Kagiso Rabada, north of 300 scalps, reached 50 in his 22nd innings. Jansen drew level with SA’s highest-wicket taker, the legendary Dale Steyn who got his 50th in his 23rd innings. He ranks ahead of Morne Morkel and Makhaya Ntini, who got theirs in 29 and 32 innings respectively.\nADVERTISEMENT\nKagiso Rabada in action\nThe strike rates are holding pretty well – Jansen’s 36.08 is the second-best of all time (min. 2000 balls bowled). He would, however, be modest about it in the company of Rabada, who boasts an astounding 38.47 SR for his 314 wickets. So quite fairly, the coast is clear for Jansen to tap greatness. It helps one way when countrymen like van der Dussen, openly admit to the batting challenge in their backyard.\nJansen and South Africa’s best this century\nPlayer\nInnings to reach 50 Test WKTs\nWKTS after corresponding match\nCareer wickets\nCareer SR\nCareer Average\nVernon Philander\n13\n51\n224\n50.8\n22.32\nKagiso Rabada\n22\n58\n314*\n38.4\n21.46\nMarco Jansen\n23\n56*\n56*\n36\n20.17\nDale Steyn\n23\n51\n439\n42.3\n22.95\nMorne Morkel\n29\n53\n309\n53.3\n27.65\nMakhaya Ntini\n32\n54\n364\n52.7\n28.93\nBatting deathbeds\nThe numbers have dwindled considerably in South Africa, with the country being the harshest on batters outside the spin quagmire in India. Since the inception of the World Test Championship, batters have averaged 25.50 per wicket in South Africa across 16 Tests, bettered marginally by batting in India at 27.97.\nSouth Africa’s Marco Jansen, right, with teammates leaves the field as he holds the ball after taking seven wickets during the second day of the first Test cricket match between South Africa and Sri Lanka, at Kingsmead stadium in Durban, South Africa. (AP)\nVisiting top-order batting (1-4) averages have collapsed to 27.35 in this period, considerably lower from the overalls of 32.93 in 251 Tests. The middle-order (5-8) runs have been vital in this time for travelling units, with as many centuries (4) coming from their bats as the top four – only five runs separating the two sets of batters on average.\nThe spicy decks can also backfire on the hosts, like when India pulled off a seven-wicket win in Cape Town earlier this year in the shortest-completed Test, with an outright result in 106 overs. As Jansen and Rabada will likely breathe more fire before New Year (two Tests each vs SL and Pak lined up), the only glaring deterrent in South Africa’s quest for reaching their maiden WTC final is going to be their own wavering willows.\nADVERTISEMENT\nJansen bowling sequence: 0, 0, 0, Wd, 0, 0, 0, 0, Nb, W, 0, 0, 1, 0, Nb, 0, W, 0, 0, 0, 0, Nb, W, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, W, 0, 0, W, 0, 0, W, 0, W"

        "content": "French President Emmanuel Macron will visit renovation works at Paris’ Notre-Dame cathedral on Friday (November 29) ahead of its reopening on December 7, five and a half years after a devastating fire destroyed its roof and spire and caused major damage throughout.\nHere is what you need to know:\nWhat is Notre-Dame?\nA medieval Gothic masterpiece, Notre-Dame de Paris (Our Lady of Paris) is one of the French capital’s most beloved and visited monuments. Its rib vaulting, flying buttresses, stunning stained-glass windows and carved stone gargoyles have long been celebrated in books and movies.\nThe first stone was laid in 1163, and construction continued for much of the next century, with major restoration and additions made in the 17th and 18th century.\nADVERTISEMENT\nVictor Hugo used the cathedral as a setting for his 1831 novel, “The Hunchback of Notre-Dame”. Quasimodo, the main character, has been portrayed by Hollywood actors including Charles Laughton and also in an animated Disney adaptation.\nWhy and how did it burn?\nOn the evening of April 15, 2019, the cathedral’s roof burst into flames. Soon, the fire had engulfed the spire and almost toppled the main bell towers. Around the world, TV viewers watched with horror as the medieval building burned. The roof collapsed but the bell towers and facade held. It remains unclear what exactly caused the fire. French authorities have said an electrical fault or a burning cigarette may have been responsible.\nWhat will happen at the opening ceremony?\nPresident Emmanuel Macron will give a speech in front of the cathedral on December 7 after which Paris’ Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will use his crozier to knock on the cathedral’s heavy doors.\nFrom within the cathedral, a psalm will be sung three times in response to the knocking, after which the doors will open. The archbishop will bless the cathedral’s ancient organ before it starts playing. This will be followed by a service.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAlso in Explained | Notre-Dame – architectural marvel and most important witness of French history\nThe service is invitation-only and the guest list is not yet known. It will be followed by a show broadcast from the cathedral square, for which details are also not yet available.\nHow was the cathedral rebuilt?\nMoney poured in from all over the world, including from French luxury sector billionaires Francois Henri Pinault and the Arnault family. So much money has been donated – more than 840 million euros ($882 million), according to Macron’s office – that there will even be funds left over for further investment in the building. The damage has needed five years’ worth of restoration work.\nWhat has changed?\nOfficials say the cathedral will be more beautiful than ever, not only because the spire, roof and anything else destroyed by the fire was rebuilt by thousands of expert craftspeople, but also because the stone and paintings, which had blackened over the years, have been thoroughly cleaned. The furniture was also renovated and cleaned, or replaced.\nNot everything was damaged in the fire. For instance, emergency workers formed a human chain to whisk gem-studded chalices and other priceless artefacts out of harm’s way."

Raghu became synonymous with loud outburts and foul-mouthed rants as a judge on the show, leading his future mother-in-law to become concerned about giving her daughter away to him. In an interview, Raghu said that he has shed that version of himself, which he has named ‘Roadies Raghu’. Comparing his alter-ego to the Incredible Hulk and calling himself Bruce Banner, Raghu said that he would never consider doing Roadies again because he cannot put himself through that turmoil.\nAppearing on the Unfiltered with AminJaz podcast, he said, “I know that people have an expectation from me that I get very worked up. That was true. But a lot happened in my life that changed me. I’m not the guy that you’ve seen, at all. I call him Roadies Raghu. He was amazing. There was a reason he was born, and that reason was justified. But later, it became unmanageable. I couldn’t live with it, so I had to let him go.”\nAlso read – Raghu Ram says divorce ‘nearly killed’ him, reveals wife Natalie’s family objected to their marriage: ‘He’s the most abusive man in India’\nADVERTISEMENT\nRaghu continued, “In my life, there have been ups and downs.

No politics. All these things really f**k me up. When people say that I should do Roadies auditions again, I say, ‘I would rather nail my d**k to a burning building than put myself through that again.”\nElaborating more about Roadies Raghu, he said, “When he comes out, it’s entertaining for everybody. But you have to understand, he’s Hulk, I’m Bruce Banner. He comes and goes, leaving me to pick up the pieces of the devastation that he’s left behind. I’m talking about him in the third person not because I’m a megalomaniac, but because I’ve had to dissociate myself from him.”\nAsked what his relationship with his alter-ego is, Raghu said, “I love that person. The reason he was there is because he protected me. He protected me at a time when I couldn’t. He expressed when I couldn’t. I’m an introvert, and I’m a non-confrontational guy. In my relationship, there is no argument that has ever happened. I don’t do it. This guy is confrontational. He picks fights. He’s like a bull in a china shop. I have to realise that he’s an aspect of my personality that is not me. I have no control over him. I love him because he protects me, but I have to keep my distance from him.”\nIn the same interview, Raghu Ram also opened up about his experiences on the show, and why he eventually quit. He said that as Roadies became more popular, the channel tried to make him do things that he wasn’t comfortable doing."

        "content": "Alarming as it may sound, children are spending unprecedented amounts of time online. Young ones are often navigating unfiltered virtual worlds. A recent UNICEF report claims that over 175,000 children log onto the internet for the first time each day—essentially one every 30 seconds. Although this endless stream of connectivity offers education and entertainment, it also puts them at serious risk. \nA recent study by AIIMS Bhopal revealed that as many as 33.1 per cent of teenagers are struggling with depression and 24.9 per cent are battling anxiety in Madhya Pradesh. The study indicates a larger pattern, calling for more attention and supervision from parents. This makes it all the more important for parents to understand the risks and proactively adopt e-safety measures to keep their children safe in this hyper-connected world.\nConsidering the numerous threats faced by children online—be it on social media platforms or through online games—we attempt to tackle this pressing issue head-on. This article is the result of insights gathered from an online safety expert, a child psychologist, and a clinical psychologist.\nADVERTISEMENT\nInternet risks for children and teenagers:\nFrom cyberbullying to online predators, the virtual world is replete with bad actors and harmful content, even exposing them to privacy breaches. While they may not seem hazardous to the unsuspecting minds, their consequences can be perilous. Addressing them is critical, and here is a look at the kinds of risks young children are exposed to as highlighted by experts:\nCyberbullying: It refers to online harassment or abuse with the use of digital technologies. Cyberbullying can occur on social media, messaging apps and games. It is often a repeated behaviour, aimed at scaring or shaming those who are targeted. Kids can be an easy target of online bullies.\nExposure to harmful content: Content that is not age appropriate such as hate speech, violence, and pornography.\nOnline sexual exploitation: Offenders contacting potential victims through social networking sites is one of the traps kids can easily fall into. Grooming is the process during which a child sexual offender draws a child in by gaining his or her trust to sexually abuse the child and maintain secrecy.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDisinformation: Encountering false or misleading information or manipulated content online.\nPrivacy breaches: Unauthorised access to personal data of children shared online.\nOnline frauds and scams: Falling for fake apps selling popular children’s products at low prices along with spending money or being tricked through gaming applications.\nFinancial and physical threats: Increased risks due to AI, deepfakes, and other emerging technologies can lead kids to financial and physical threats.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to Ami Kumar, online security expert and founder of Social & Media Matters, “grooming, financial scams, and deepfake threats are among the most common and serious online risks for children.” Social & Media Matters is an organization working for child online safety for the past decade.\nICYMI | Are you safe on public Wi-Fi? What you need to know now\nOnline harm is not limited to fraud and scams; another persisting issue is the excessive screen time among children. Unchecked screen time can affect their mental and physical well-being, such as poor quality of sleep, strain on eyes, and reduced physical activity. This can also lead to an impact on cognitive development, social skills, and emotional well-being, making it all the more vital to manage screen time among children.\nScreen time guidelines according to the Indian Academy of Pediatrics:\nTo help parents navigate the challenge of online safety, the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) provides screen time guidelines tailored to different age groups:\n\n📌Children below the age of two should not be exposed to any type of screen with the exception of occasional video calls with relatives.\n\n📌Screen time for children between the ages of two and five years should not exceed an hour; the lesser, the better, under parental guidance, monitoring what the children are watching.\n\n📌For older children and adolescents, it is important to balance screen time with other activities required for overall development. These activities include an hour of physical activity (playtime), adequate duration of sleep (recommended sleep time varies with age; for example, adolescents require eight to nine hours of uninterrupted sleep at night), and time for schoolwork, meals, hobbies, and family time. If any of these activities is disrupted due to screen use, then it can be termed excessive screen time, and efforts should be made to reduce it.\nWhat experts say\nDr Jaya Shivalkar, child and adolescent psychologist and developmental paediatrician, said, “The impact of screen time on a child depends on their age. Children aged seven-eight are in a crucial developmental phase, and extended exposure to screens can hinder social and oral development, leading to anxiety, introverted behaviour, and even school phobia.” \nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to Shivalkar, another major concern is the increasing disconnect with reality as they delve more into fantasy. “For children over 10, basic learning skills are affected, and compulsive behaviour can develop, resulting in aggression. By adolescence, such behaviours often escalate into addiction. Physically, issues like obesity and deteriorating eyesight are also common concerns.”\nWhile awareness is key, experts suggest that parents need not instill fear in children about the internet. (Image: FreePik)\nMoreover, being exposed to inappropriate content at a young age can be detrimental to their overall development. “Exposure to inappropriate content online can have a variety of consequences. Children and adolescents may experience anxiety and fear. It is common to see graphics or hate-based content that aren’t censored online and that can cause a lot of fear,” said Sharmishtha Hardas, a clinical psychologist. \nHardas feels that the use of social media can also set unrealistic standards of beauty and lead to comparison and lowered self-esteem. “In severe cases, body dissatisfaction can lead to eating disorders and body dysmorphia,” she said.\nHow can parents identify the warning signs?\nAccording to experts, the following are the warning signs that can help parents identify if their children are in trouble:\nADVERTISEMENT\nBehavioural changes: Changes such as becoming unusually quiet or aggressive; requesting more money, privacy, or alone time; avoiding age-appropriate activities like going out, eating with family, or playing; displaying irritability, aggression, or abusive behaviour when gadgets are taken away are some behavioural changes parents spot.\nEmotional indicators: Mood swings or being unusually secretive can be one of the major emotional indicators, social withdrawal or isolation and even decline in academic performance can be usual warning signs for parents.\nPhysical and routine changes: Spending more time on mobile phones, often secretly, sleep disturbances or complaints of headaches can also be considered as primary warning signs.\nGeneral observation: Any noticeable change in a child’s behavior typically has a reason, and in today’s context, it often stems from online activity.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRole of communication between parents and kids:\nShivalkar believes that parents should become role models for kids. “Parents should set good examples. If they use their smartphones all the time, then they cannot talk to kids about their ill effects. There is a need for conscious parenting. And, parents must be more alert, educated, and aware than the kids,” she said. “Parents should encourage kids to indulge in alternative hobbies such as arts and sports.”\n“Parents need to develop the art of holding conversations while keeping their child’s comfort in mind. These conversations need not be limited to online safety but can also include topics like sexuality, drug use, and education,” says Kumar. The online safety expert asserts that before giving a child access to a device or Wi-Fi network, parents should understand its purpose and be informed about the apps their child uses.\nAlso Read | Is your child addicted to smartphones? Psychologist shares 7 reasons to be concerned\n“Avoid installing apps unless you know what they do, who uses them, and the type of interactions they allow. Simply following trends is unsafe. A quick search, such as the app’s name followed by ‘child safety,’ can provide useful details about the app and its security features. Once your child is online, engage them in conversations about their activities—for example, ask what games they play or how things are going,” said Kumar, adding that the earlier parents intervene, less harm is likely to occur.\n“For kids under 8 years of age, the conversations should be around what they see on the internet, teaching them not to share personal details online, and avoiding interactions with strangers. For pre-teens, the discussion should focus on the significance of privacy settings on apps, digital footprint, and the importance of avoiding inappropriate content,” said Hardas. \nADVERTISEMENT\nCommunication is key to keeping your child safe online. (Image: FreePik)\nHardas says recognising cyberbullying, reporting it and informing parents should be encouraged among children. She emphasised that there is no need to instill fear in their children about the internet.\nWhat about a child’s privacy?\nIn an ideal world, parents should respect their child’s privacy online. However, this respect should be balanced with appropriate guidance and supervision to ensure they are safe.\nKumar strongly feels that respecting a child’s privacy is a foreign concept created by big tech companies. “A child’s privacy can be secondary to their safety. Till the age of 18, it is parents, school, and society that are responsible for the child’s safety,” he said, highlighting that it is completely on the parent to keep their child safe.\nShivalkar too feels that parents are afraid to infiltrate the privacy of their kids. But up to 18 years, all screen content needs to be monitored by parents. On the other hand, Kumar notes that parental controls are effective. \nADVERTISEMENT\nAlso Read | Your smartphone is frying your brain: Neuroscientist explains how increased screen time is impacting our lives\n“Most platforms and apps have the option of parental controls. Parents can also find multiple options to customise the online experience. Instagram has recently launched a new feature where algorithms can be completely reset; this makes sure young ones are only seeing content that is entertaining, educating, and fun for them, and none of the harmful content comes into their timeline if they are using their parents’ phone,” said Kumar. \nWhere to seek help?\nExperts always mention that parents should seek help the moment they feel that something is off, but from where and how are questions. Shivalkar offers a simple answer, “Pediatricians where your kids go since they are born is where you take them once you notice warning signs. Pediatricians all over the country are constantly trained to deal with these issues. And taking children to them is less of a task, since they are accustomed to the visit from their childhood.\nCan parents seek help from schools?\nYes, experts suggest that schools can be approached for further help. “In certain cases, children tend to follow things taught in school more and hence parents should ask for awareness activities from school in cases of online safety, schools can play a better role,” Shivalkar said.\n“Schools play a very important role, education and capacity building should come from schools. Parents need to make sure that children are made aware of online safety through schools,” Ami said. \nGeneral guidelines for parents:\nExperts recommend the following tips to help parents keep their children safe online:\n📌Practise open and unbiased communication with your children.\n📌Follow screen time guidelines recommended by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics.\n📌Be firm in saying “no” to gadgets, even if children use emotional tactics.\n📌Lead by example and limit your gadget use at home.\n📌Watch for early signs of screen addiction.\n📌Seek help from a pediatrician or child psychologist if needed."

        "content": "Australia batter Steve Smith has lauded pacer Jasprit Bumrah and his “unorthodox bowling action” and “exceptional skill-set.”\nBumrah bagged eight wickets in the Perth Test match, including a five-wicket haul in the first innings, and helped his side to a 295-run victory. India’s stand-in skipper for the first Test was also adjudged player of the match for his performance.\n“From the start of his run-up, it’s just all awkward,” Smith told the Sydney Morning Herald.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The way he runs in is different to pretty much anyone else, then the last bit of his action is different. I’ve faced him a reasonable amount now, and each time you face him it takes a few balls just to get the rhythm of it in a way.”\nFormer Australia captain Smith explained how Bumrah’s release point is at least a foot closer to the batters than any other bowler making it that much difficult to pick the length.\n“He releases the ball closer to you than any other bowler, just the way he does it. So maybe it rushes you a bit more than you think, and it’s just an awkward action,” said Smith, who was trapped by Bumrah for a duck in the first innings.\n“Put that together with his skill set—he swings it both ways, he can nip it off the seam, he can reverse it, got a good slower ball, a good bouncer—he’s pretty much the complete package as a bowler.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIndia will next face Australia in the Pink-ball Test in Adelaide starting December 6."

        "content": "Sorgavaasal Movie Review: Prison films are tough to crack, but the allure of this genre is understandable. It is essentially a chamber drama where every character is unpredictable, and the audience is tuned to expect them to get violent at any time. These characters are ticking time bombs, and the setting allows the writers to explore the human psyche and deliver a solid character-driven drama. With this base in place, one can add the required flavours like romance, sentiment, revenge, and even comedy, and a prison film will have the space for it all. What really matters is the proportion of each, and for the longest time in Sorgavaasal, debutant director Sidharth Vishwanath, along with his co-writers Tamizh Prabha and Ashwin Ravichandran, get it right. However, despite perfectly building a Virumaandi meets Vada Chennai narrative to a crescendo, they falter at the end. But the characters, and its effective portrayal, ensure Sorgavaasal escapes without crashing and burning. \nSorgavaasal opens with jailer Kattabomman (Karunaas) saying this was a job he didn’t want to do. It is a job that neither helps him gain respect nor make money with bribes. Then, he lets us know that given a choice between being a servant in heaven and a king in hell, many of us would choose the latter. And who is he telling all of this to? It is investigating officer Ismail (Natty), who is trying to understand the machinations of a bloody prison riot that ended with 45 deaths, and 60 reported missing cases. Through this investigation, we are introduced to the various guards of this not-so-pearly gates of ‘heaven’. \nYou have exhausted your monthly limit of free stories.\nRegister to read more stories\nSign up\nAlready have an account?

        "content": "Hindu Sena president Vishnu Gupta, whose petition asking for a survey of the Ajmer Sharif Dargah was admitted by a local court on Wednesday, runs an organisation that has in the past been linked to the defacement of signboards in the national capital, holding a havan for Donald Trump’s victory, the assault of Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan, and the targeting of AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi’s Delhi residence.\nOn Wednesday, the court issued notices to the Ministry of Minority Affairs, the Archaeological Survey of India, and the Ajmer Dargah Committee, and listed the matter for December 20.\nGupta, 40, was born in Etah, Uttar Pradesh, and moved to Delhi at a young age. He joined the Shiv Sena’s youth wing as a student, and became part of the Bajrang Dal in 2008.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn 2011, he and some others founded the Hindu Sena, an organisation that he claims has “lakhs of members” now, with units in “almost all parts of India”.\nOn its website, the Hindu Sena says it “aims to oppose the Islamisation in any form, Sharia law implementation, love jihad and Islamic extremism in India”, and that it would “highlight and protest and take legal action against any person/entity causing harm to the sovereignty of India and Sanatana Dharma”.\nHis petition in Ajmer is the not the first time he or his outfit have knocked on the court’s doors. In 2022, a Bench led by the then Supreme Court Judge, Justice D Y Chandrachud, rejected an intervention application filed by Gupta in May that year, seeking dismissal of the petition filed by Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Management Committee, which had challenged the videographic survey of the Gyanvapi Mosque complex in Varanasi.\nIn February 2023, a Supreme Court bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and M M Sundresh dismissed a petition by the Hindu Sena seeking a ban on the BBC for its documentary on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the 2002 Gujarat riots, calling it “completely misconceived”.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn April 2024, the Delhi High Court rejected a petition filed by the Hindu Sena seeking the removal of Arvind Kejriwal from the post of Chief Minister following his arrest.\nHe and his outfit have also faced several police cases. Asked about these, Gupta said, “I don’t know how many FIRs have been lodged against me. Ab koi chor batayega humne kitni chori kari hai? (Will a thief tell you how much he has stolen?).”\nIn October 2011, an FIR was lodged against Gupta and BJP’s Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga for allegedly assaulting Bhushan at his chamber in the court. Gupta was subsequently arrested by the Delhi Police. In October 2015, he was arrested for allegedly giving false information about beef being served at Delhi’s Kerala House.\nIn June 2017, an FIR was lodged against Gupta and Hindu Sena members, allegedly for barging into the CPM headquarters in Delhi and manhandling party general secretary Sitaram Yechury.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn November 2020, a case was lodged against Gupta following a complaint by the New Delhi Municipal Corporation for allegedly defacing the signboard of the India Islamic Cultural Centre and pasting a poster that read Jihadi Terrorist Islamic Centre.\nIn September 2021, five members of Hindu Sena were arrested for allegedly vandalising the residence of AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi.\nIn June 2022, the Hindu Sena allegedly organised an event at Vishwagiri temple in Rajouri Garden and held a “sword distribution” in support of Nupur Sharma following her suspension by the BJP for alleged objectionable comments on the Prophet. A complaint was filed before the National Commission for Minorities.\nIn August 2023, the Delhi Police stopped a mahapanchyat organised by the Hindu Sena, including Gupta, at Jantar Mantar for alleged inflammatory speeches with references to communal violence in Haryana’s Nuh.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe and his outfit have also been in the news for allegedly defacing the signboards of Akbar Road and Feroz Shah Road in Delhi; vandalising the office of Pakistan International Airlines; protesting the then Home Minister Rajnath Singh’s visit to Pakistan in 2016; organising a havan to ensure the victory of Trump in the presidential election the same year; amd throwing ink on J&K MLA Engineer Rashid in 2021."

        "content": "The Uttar Pradesh government’s plan to put up posters with photographs of more than 100 protesters allegedly involved in the Sambhal violence on November 24 is not the first time the Yogi Adityanath administration has considered naming and shaming people accused of damaging public properties during protesters.\nThe government first responded in this manner in the aftermath of the widespread protests in the state against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in 2020. On March 6, 2020, the UP government put up posters at major crossings in Lucknow containing the names, photographs, and addresses of 57 anti-CAA protesters identified through CCTV and other visuals. Among those shown in the posters were leading activists, including Congress leader Sadaf Jafar, Rihai Manch founder Mohammad Shoaib and Deepak Kabir, prominent Shia cleric Kalbe Sadiq’s son Kalbe Sibtain Noori, and retired IPS officer and activist S R Darapuri.\nThe accused were asked to pay compensation for allegedly damaging public properties during the protests. The government sought to recover Rs 1.55 crore from these protesters and warned them that their properties would be seized if they failed to pay up.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThree days later, the Allahabad High Court took suo motu cognizance of the incident and asked the Lucknow administration to remove the hoardings of those booked in cases of alleged vandalism, calling it an interference in their privacy.\nThe court listed the matter for hearing on March 16 but before that, the UP government moved the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court. The Supreme Court observed there was no law to support the government’s action but did not pass any interim order. Moving swiftly, the Adityanath government decided to come up with its own law to lay down the procedure to punish those guilty of damaging public property.\nOn March 15, the government issued an Ordinance to define the procedure and punishment in such cases and soon it was promulgated into the Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Damages to Public and Private Property Act, 2020, which the state Assembly passed in August.\nWith the matter still pending in courts, posters with the photos and details of the anti-CAA protesters came up again in public places on November 6. These posters declared them as absconders and announced a Rs 5,000 reward for information about them. These accused were booked under the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn July 2021, the Supreme Court, while hearing a petition filed by one Parwaiz Arif Titu seeking to quash these notices, directed the UP government not to take action on earlier notices sent to the protesters for recovery of damages. In compliance, the government in February 2022 withdrew 274 recovery notices that were issued before it passed the new law on recovery of damages and assured that it would look into the matter as per the new law. Now, as per the new law, cases of recovery of damages are heard by a claims tribunal."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ug-students-courses-adp-edp-duration-9697014/?ref=newlist_hp",
        "content": "Undergraduate students will soon have flexibility in completing their programmes in less or more time than the standard three or four years, following a recent decision by the University Grants Commission (UGC).\nWhether students opt for an ‘accelerated’ or ‘extended’ timeline, they will earn the same degree as those on the standard track, provided they fulfil all academic requirements. Higher education institutions can offer these options starting with the 2025-26 academic session.\nHere’s what the programmes might look like and how they could benefit students.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhat are ‘Accelerated Degree Programmes’ (ADPs) and ‘Extended Degree Programmes’ (EDPs)?\nAt the end of the first or second semester, but not beyond, undergraduate students will be allowed to opt for an ADP or an EDP. Students enrolled under an ADP will follow the same curriculum and must earn the same number of credits as required for a three- or four-year UG programme. However, they can complete their programme sooner by earning additional credits starting from the semester they choose the ADP.\nUnder this scheme, a three-year UG programme can be completed in five semesters instead of the standard six (shortened by a maximum of one semester), while a four-year UG programme can be completed in six or seven semesters (shortened by a maximum of two semesters) rather than eight.\nOn the other hand, students who choose the EDP will be allowed to earn fewer credits per semester compared to the standard programme, allowing them to take longer to complete their course. Their course duration can be extended by a maximum of two semesters.\nWhat is the objective behind ADP and EDP, and who may benefit from it?\nUGC Chairman M Jagadesh Kumar said the National Credit Framework allows students to complete UG courses in accelerated or extended programmes to accommodate “diverse academic needs and cognitive abilities”.\nADVERTISEMENT\nExplained | First phase of ‘One Nation One Subscription’ approved: How the scheme can improve govt institutions’ access to journals\n“ADP allows high-performing students to complete their degrees faster by earning additional credits and allowing them to enter the workforce or pursue higher studies sooner. Conversely, EDP supports students who face academic challenges by offering them an extended timeline to complete their degrees at a manageable pace. Together, these options promote equity, ensuring all learners have the means to achieve their educational goals,” he added.\nHow will they be implemented?\nThe UGC’s recently approved Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) calls for higher education institutions to set up a committee to scrutinise the applications they receive for ADP and EDP at the end of the first or second semester and select students accordingly. According to the SOP, the committee will evaluate the “credit-completing potential” of the student based on their performance in the first or second semester. An institution can earmark up to 10% of the sanctioned intake for ADP students.\nOn the SOP not having such a cap for the number of EDP students, Kumar said: “Students with weaker academic performance often require more time to understand and apply concepts. EDP enables them to take fewer credits per semester, allowing them to focus intensely on each course without the stress of heavy workloads. This is why we have not kept any upper limit for EDP.”\nThe committee will also decide the minimum number of credits a student must earn in each semester under the ADP and the EDP, considering the UGC’s Curriculum and Credit Framework for Undergraduate Programmes.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWill the exams or degrees be any different from standard ones?\nThe exams will remain the same as standard three- or four-year UG programmes. The SOP says that government departments, private organisations, and recruiting agencies should treat ADP and EDP degrees on par with degrees completed in the standard duration. It adds that the degree should contain a note that states that the academic requirements for a standard programme have been completed in a shorter or extended duration.\nAlso Read | India’s National Education Policy, 2020, explained\nKumar said: “ADP and EDP apply to both three-year UG programmes or four-year UG programmes with honours/honours with research. For students opting for either ADP or EDP, earning the total credits required in a standard four-year UG Programme with honours/honours with research would qualify for an Honours degree.”\nWhen will the options kick in and how will institutions prepare?\nADVERTISEMENT\nKumar said higher education institutions can start offering ADP or EDP from the July-August session in the 2025-26 academic year. It would be up to the institutions to decide whether they would like to offer these programmes.\n“Institutions can offer courses in online or hybrid modes, leveraging the UGC’s approval for up to 40% of courses being delivered online. This will allow students in ADP or EDP to take additional or fewer credits at their own pace without disrupting regular class schedules. Additional classes can be scheduled outside standard hours to accommodate ADP students. This option benefits students who want face-to-face interactions but have a compressed timeline,” Kumar said.\nHe added: “ADP students can enrol in advanced or specialised courses already part of postgraduate or advanced undergraduate curricula, allowing them to fulfil credit requirements more efficiently. Micro-credentials can be introduced, enabling students to accumulate credits at their convenience. These can include skill-based programs that align with degree requirements. Higher education institutions could introduce an inter-semester term (e.g., summer or winter) where ADP students can take additional courses. This would not interfere with the regular semester structure. Students can take electives or core courses from different departments to flexibly manage their credits.”"

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-military-clampdown-may-not-keep-imran-khan-down-9696790/?ref=newlist_hp",
        "content": "Early on Wednesday morning, protestors belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were beaten into retreat from Islamabad after several days of clashes with military and paramilitary authorities. While verified figures are still awaited, several eye-witness accounts report the use of live ammunition late on Tuesday night,-early Wednesday morning, resulting in at least eight deaths. These events mark the fourth major confrontation between government authorities and the PTI in the last six months, centred on the issue of ex-PM Imran Khan’s continued incarceration and ongoing crackdowns against his party across the country.\nRights violations and heavy coercion against the PTI characterise an ongoing phase of political instability, which can be traced back to at least April 2022, following a breakdown of relations between the military and Khan, and the latter’s ouster from government and eventual arrest.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSince then, the military’s domination of executive affairs has only grown via another civilian face — a Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz led government featuring Shehbaz Sharif as PM — put in place through a heavily compromised general election in February this year. Earlier this month, the ruling regime further tightened its hold on state affairs through a constitutional amendment that transferred control of judicial appointments and bench selection to the executive.\nExpress View | Pakistan’s political crisis: No winners of face-off\nWith PTI having been violently coerced off the streets of Islamabad, Khan still under arrest, and the constitutional amendment still in place, the ruling regime appears to have won the latest round.\nImmediate post-mortem of the aborted protest reveals three issues. The first was a miscalculation of the extent to which the government would use violent means to disperse protestors once they had entered Islamabad. Excessive, life-endangering violence, sees periodic use in Pakistan’s so-called peripheries of the tribal districts and Balochistan, but is rarely deployed as a crowd-control method in the heartland, let alone the federal capital. The unexpected escalation in state violence, on the pretext of the security of visiting Belarusian President, and the ensuing panic brought the sit-in to a bloody end.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe second was leadership indecision. The protests were simultaneously led by Ali Amin Gandapur, chief minister of the PTI-ruled Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, and Bushra Bibi, the incarcerated ex-PM’s wife. At various points, the convoys appeared to be moving at different speeds, and insider accounts now report there were internal disagreements within the leadership and between the leaders and protestors on the final destination. These were perhaps best captured in a short video clip where PTI protestors can be seen urging a visibly frazzled Gandapur to stay the course and pick up speed.\nThird, the bulk of the mobilisation came south to the capital from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa relatively unencumbered, with the expectation that reinforcements traveling north from Punjab would arrive. That part never materialised. Pre-emptive measures taken by the government to arrest party activists and lock down entry and exit points of all major urban centers, such as Lahore, severely constrained mobility across the province. The provincial leadership in Punjab, too, seemed less enthused by the prospect of a prolonged sit-in.\nRead more | US mission in Pakistan issues security alert, advises Americans to avoid Peshawar hotel\nWhile the government chalks this down as a victory, and the PTI reflects on its internal troubles, the underlying factors driving episodic instability in the political sphere remain in place. A coerced calm in Islamabad simply cannot paper over the fact that the current ruling arrangement is plagued by an absence of popular legitimacy. February’s election, which birthed the current parliament and resulted in a PMLN-led central government, was compromised by the denial of franchise to PTI voters, the incarceration of its candidates, and the manipulation of polling-day outcomes.\nThese polls happened in the midst of Pakistan’s worst cost-of-living crisis in recent history, with inflation rates well above 20 per cent, and the economy teetering on the brink of default. While macroeconomic indicators have stabilised in recent months, the wholesale erosion of real wages and living standards since late 2021 remains fresh in people’s memory.\nThe government’s proclamation of economic stability rests on a current account surplus and growing dollar reserves does little to assuage the violence inflicted on common households by an average growth rate of less than 2 per cent over these past three years. However, seeing the current wave of popular discontentment as a mere spasmodic response to economic distress would be doing an analytical disservice. No amount of violent curtailment or internal disarray can deny the entrenched ideational popularity of Imran Khan and his party.\nIn the past decade, the PTI has risen head and shoulders above all other parties to cultivate an informational ecosystem with unprecedented reach and penetration across the country. It draws on Islam-inflected imagery and narrations, Khan’s personal appeal as a political (and even spiritual) leader, and a consistent portrayal of politics as an existential fight against a corrupt cabal (that since 2022 also features the military high command). All of it disseminated through viral TikToks, WhatsApp forwards, and Facebook videos to vast swathes of a population fully immersed in the digital realm.\nMOST READ\n1\nThe JEE system is broken.

Reminiscent of domestic politics the world over, Pakistan’s traditional parties, like the PMLN and PPP, are struggling to expand their support base against a populist upsurge, taking refuge instead in dynastic control and sclerotic distribution of patronage to key constituents, such as a delegitimised mainstream media. This strategy offers rapidly diminishing returns, at best.\nBut perhaps most crucially, Pakistan’s military high command is in the throes of a crisis of public appeal due to its turn against Khan in 2022. Its conventional core support base among the urban middle class of Punjab now firmly leads PTI’s oppositional charge, leaving scant access to alternative sources of legitimacy. In this configuration, stability in the political sphere can only be enforced through coercion. And it seems that will remain the dominant order of the day in the months to come.\nThe writer teaches politics and sociology at the Gurmani School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), in Lahore, Pakistan"

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/rajya-sabha-seat-scramble-ticker-in-haryana-bjp-9696407/?ref=newlist_hp",
        "content": "Intense lobbying has started in Haryana BJP after the Election Commission (EC) announced that a bypoll for a Rajya Sabha seat will be held on December 20.\nThe bypoll has been necessitated by the resignation of Krishan Lal Panwar who was elected to the Assembly and subsequently became a Cabinet Minister in the Nayab Singh Saini government. Now the vacant seat is being eyed by senior leader and former Bhiwani and Hisar MP Kuldeep Bishnoi, state BJP chief Mohan Lal Badoli, former Karnal MP Sanjay Bhatia, former state Cabinet Minister Om Prakash Dhankar, and former MP Sunita Duggal.\nBishnoi, a three-time MLA and two-time Lok Sabha MP, met Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi on Wednesday. BJP sources told The Indian Express that Bishnoi wanted to reach the Upper House of Parliament just as fellow Congress rebel Kiran Choudhry did in September. Choudhry quit the Congress in June and joined the BJP. Three months later, she moved to the Rajya Sabha, winning from the seat that Congress’s Deepender Hooda vacated after he was elected to the Lok Sabha from Rohtak. Choudhry was elected unopposed after the Congress did not field any candidate because of inadequate numbers.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis time too, the BJP nominee is all set to be elected unopposed as the party has an absolute majority with 48 MLAs in the 90-member House and enjoys the support of three Independent MLAs. The Congress has 37 MLAs and the Indian National Lok Dak has two legislators.\n“Kuldeep Bishnoi is trying hard not to let this opportunity go. It is, however, the party’s central leadership that will decide who will be considered for the Rajya Sabha. Everybody will follow the party’s decision,” a senior BJP leader told The Indian Express.\nBishnoi, according to party insiders, was interested in September too, holding several meetings with senior leaders in Delhi. But the central leadership ultimately decided to send Choudhry to Parliament. This time, his position is a bit more weakened as his son and former Adampur MLA Bhavya Bishnoi lost the family seat for the first time in history. The Bishnoi family had distanced itself from the BJP’s programmes after the results, with both father and son not being seen in party events, including one that CM Saini attended on November 25 in Hisar. Before that, they did not attend party meetings convened by Badoli in Hisar. BJP leaders said the Bishnois were unhappy at being given prominence in the state unit.\nAmong the other top contenders are Badoli, who lost the Lok Sabha polls this year from Sonipat; former Karnal MP Bhatia who gave up the seat for Manohar Lal Khattar in the Lok Sabha polls, and was later appointed to the BJP’s election management committee; Dhankhar; and Duggal. The chances of the last two are considered relatively not that high as they lost the recent Assembly elections: Dhankhar from Badli (for the second straight time) and Duggal from the Ratia (Scheduled Caste-reserved) seat.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Bhatia deserves to be rewarded for his performance and taking him to the Rajya Sabha could be it. He also has experience of the Lok Sabha and it will be good for the party if he is considered,” said a BJP leader. Bhatia was the party’s western Uttar Pradesh co-in-charge during the Lok Sabha elections and is a known Khattar loyalist.\n“Whoever is elected shall have almost two years in the Rajya Sabha. Krishan Panwar was elected to the Rajya Sabha in 2020 and resigned in October. The BJP’s parliamentary board will decide, with the process beginning after the poll notification is issued on December 3,” said a senior party leader."

        "content": "Does Thursday’s Durban mania elevate Marco Jansen’s pedigree in the international bowling space as a menacing, unplayable beast when at his best?\nAll-time batting lows have been the flavour of late in Test cricket. Sri Lanka’s precipitous collapse for 42 all out at Kingsmead also impressed that Jansen can be as good a rhythm bowler as any, even if he may not have channelled the consistency factor yet. The 6-foot-9 left-armer’s 7-for may have passed on memories of Mohammed Siraj’s Lanka dahan last year.\nJansen, though, is getting steadier even if his latest haul might not be his most skilful work. The seven-wicket sequence comprising three bowled, one caught-and-bowled, and one caught at first, second and third slip each, would rank as a significant numerical hallmark. It also prompted Jansen’s compatriot Rassie van der Dussen, who last played a Test in 2022, to write on social media: “South Africa is the toughest place to bat in Test cricket. Change my mind.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nSouth Africa’s Marco Jansen leaves the field as he holds the ball after taking seven wickets during the second day of the first Test cricket match between South Africa and Sri Lanka, at Kingsmead stadium in Durban, South Africa, Thursday, Nov. 28, 2024. (AP Photo/Themba Hadebe)\nFast 7\nJansen’s incredible burst packed Sri Lanka for 42 in only 13.5 overs (83 balls), making it the second shortest completed Test innings in history and the lowest in 100 years since South Africa’s capitulation in England in June 1924 (30 all out in 7.5 overs).\nThe innings also marked the fourth sub-50 total for visiting teams in South Africa, the most for any country in the 21st century. Jansen picked up his first off his eighth delivery. 33 balls later, he was leading his side off the field with the best figures (7/13) by a South African pacer this century.\nSouth Africa’s Marco Jansen, left, celebrates with teammates after Sri Lanka’s Pathum Nissanka’s out for 3 runs during the second day of the first Test cricket match between South Africa and Sri Lanka, at Kingsmead stadium in Durban, South Africa, (AP)\nJansen’s spell was the joint-quickest in deliveries to reach seven wickets by a bowler in an innings, matching Hugh Trumble’s 41-ball 7-fer for Australia in the Ashes in 1904. He may not have dismayed the opposition quite like Curtly Ambrose during his famous 7/1 sequence in Perth (he was 0/24 before scalping his first wicket), but Jansen’s 7/9 (excluding extras) will also rank among the best Test bowling sequences for anyone who’s picked as many in an innings. Fourth-best by a pacer, in fact, and the fastest since Ambrose’s WACA massacre in February 1993.\nBest recorded 7-wicket Test sequences by pacers\n7/9 – (25 balls) Monty Noble 7/17 – Aus v Eng, 1901/02\n7/2 – (28 balls): George Lohmann 8/7 – Eng v SA, 1895/96\n7/1 – (30 balls) Sarfraz Nawaz 9/86 – Pak v Aus, 1978/79*\n7/1 – (32 balls): Curtly Ambrose 7/25 -WI v Aus, 1992/93\n7/9 – (33 balls): Marco Jansen 7/13 – SA v SL, 2024*\n• – excluding wide, no-balls\nLevelling up with Steyn, Rabada\nWhile consistency can almost instantly pull Jansen to the top seam-bowling bracket today, his fledgling career is far from middling, jostling between good and great. The 24-year-old went past 50 wickets with the seven-for in his 23rd innings, moving up to 56 scalps with a 20.17 average. That puts him on par with South Africa’s four-best pacers this century. His teammate Kagiso Rabada, north of 300 scalps, reached 50 in his 22nd innings. Jansen drew level with SA’s highest-wicket taker, the legendary Dale Steyn who got his 50th in his 23rd innings. He ranks ahead of Morne Morkel and Makhaya Ntini, who got theirs in 29 and 32 innings respectively.\nADVERTISEMENT\nKagiso Rabada in action\nThe strike rates are holding pretty well – Jansen’s 36.08 is the second-best of all time (min. 2000 balls bowled). He would, however, be modest about it in the company of Rabada, who boasts an astounding 38.47 SR for his 314 wickets. So quite fairly, the coast is clear for Jansen to tap greatness.

(AP)\nVisiting top-order batting (1-4) averages have collapsed to 27.35 in this period, considerably lower from the overalls of 32.93 in 251 Tests. The middle-order (5-8) runs have been vital in this time for travelling units, with as many centuries (4) coming from their bats as the top four – only five runs separating the two sets of batters on average.\nThe spicy decks can also backfire on the hosts, like when India pulled off a seven-wicket win in Cape Town earlier this year in the shortest-completed Test, with an outright result in 106 overs. As Jansen and Rabada will likely breathe more fire before New Year (two Tests each vs SL and Pak lined up), the only glaring deterrent in South Africa’s quest for reaching their maiden WTC final is going to be their own wavering willows.\nADVERTISEMENT\nJansen bowling sequence: 0, 0, 0, Wd, 0, 0, 0, 0, Nb, W, 0, 0, 1, 0, Nb, 0, W, 0, 0, 0, 0, Nb, W, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, W, 0, 0, W, 0, 0, W, 0, W"

        "content": "Alarming as it may sound, children are spending unprecedented amounts of time online. Young ones are often navigating unfiltered virtual worlds. A recent UNICEF report claims that over 175,000 children log onto the internet for the first time each day—essentially one every 30 seconds. Although this endless stream of connectivity offers education and entertainment, it also puts them at serious risk. \nA recent study by AIIMS Bhopal revealed that as many as 33.1 per cent of teenagers are struggling with depression and 24.9 per cent are battling anxiety in Madhya Pradesh. The study indicates a larger pattern, calling for more attention and supervision from parents. This makes it all the more important for parents to understand the risks and proactively adopt e-safety measures to keep their children safe in this hyper-connected world.\nConsidering the numerous threats faced by children online—be it on social media platforms or through online games—we attempt to tackle this pressing issue head-on. This article is the result of insights gathered from an online safety expert, a child psychologist, and a clinical psychologist.\nADVERTISEMENT\nInternet risks for children and teenagers:\nFrom cyberbullying to online predators, the virtual world is replete with bad actors and harmful content, even exposing them to privacy breaches. While they may not seem hazardous to the unsuspecting minds, their consequences can be perilous. Addressing them is critical, and here is a look at the kinds of risks young children are exposed to as highlighted by experts:\nCyberbullying: It refers to online harassment or abuse with the use of digital technologies. Cyberbullying can occur on social media, messaging apps and games. It is often a repeated behaviour, aimed at scaring or shaming those who are targeted. Kids can be an easy target of online bullies.\nExposure to harmful content: Content that is not age appropriate such as hate speech, violence, and pornography.\nOnline sexual exploitation: Offenders contacting potential victims through social networking sites is one of the traps kids can easily fall into. Grooming is the process during which a child sexual offender draws a child in by gaining his or her trust to sexually abuse the child and maintain secrecy.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDisinformation: Encountering false or misleading information or manipulated content online.\nPrivacy breaches: Unauthorised access to personal data of children shared online.\nOnline frauds and scams: Falling for fake apps selling popular children’s products at low prices along with spending money or being tricked through gaming applications.\nFinancial and physical threats: Increased risks due to AI, deepfakes, and other emerging technologies can lead kids to financial and physical threats.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to Ami Kumar, online security expert and founder of Social & Media Matters, “grooming, financial scams, and deepfake threats are among the most common and serious online risks for children.” Social & Media Matters is an organization working for child online safety for the past decade.\nICYMI | Are you safe on public Wi-Fi? What you need to know now\nOnline harm is not limited to fraud and scams; another persisting issue is the excessive screen time among children. Unchecked screen time can affect their mental and physical well-being, such as poor quality of sleep, strain on eyes, and reduced physical activity. This can also lead to an impact on cognitive development, social skills, and emotional well-being, making it all the more vital to manage screen time among children.\nScreen time guidelines according to the Indian Academy of Pediatrics:\nTo help parents navigate the challenge of online safety, the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) provides screen time guidelines tailored to different age groups:\n\n📌Children below the age of two should not be exposed to any type of screen with the exception of occasional video calls with relatives.\n\n📌Screen time for children between the ages of two and five years should not exceed an hour; the lesser, the better, under parental guidance, monitoring what the children are watching.\n\n📌For older children and adolescents, it is important to balance screen time with other activities required for overall development. These activities include an hour of physical activity (playtime), adequate duration of sleep (recommended sleep time varies with age; for example, adolescents require eight to nine hours of uninterrupted sleep at night), and time for schoolwork, meals, hobbies, and family time. If any of these activities is disrupted due to screen use, then it can be termed excessive screen time, and efforts should be made to reduce it.\nWhat experts say\nDr Jaya Shivalkar, child and adolescent psychologist and developmental paediatrician, said, “The impact of screen time on a child depends on their age. Children aged seven-eight are in a crucial developmental phase, and extended exposure to screens can hinder social and oral development, leading to anxiety, introverted behaviour, and even school phobia.” \nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to Shivalkar, another major concern is the increasing disconnect with reality as they delve more into fantasy. “For children over 10, basic learning skills are affected, and compulsive behaviour can develop, resulting in aggression. By adolescence, such behaviours often escalate into addiction. Physically, issues like obesity and deteriorating eyesight are also common concerns.”\nWhile awareness is key, experts suggest that parents need not instill fear in children about the internet. (Image: FreePik)\nMoreover, being exposed to inappropriate content at a young age can be detrimental to their overall development. “Exposure to inappropriate content online can have a variety of consequences. Children and adolescents may experience anxiety and fear. It is common to see graphics or hate-based content that aren’t censored online and that can cause a lot of fear,” said Sharmishtha Hardas, a clinical psychologist. \nHardas feels that the use of social media can also set unrealistic standards of beauty and lead to comparison and lowered self-esteem. “In severe cases, body dissatisfaction can lead to eating disorders and body dysmorphia,” she said.\nHow can parents identify the warning signs?\nAccording to experts, the following are the warning signs that can help parents identify if their children are in trouble:\nADVERTISEMENT\nBehavioural changes: Changes such as becoming unusually quiet or aggressive; requesting more money, privacy, or alone time; avoiding age-appropriate activities like going out, eating with family, or playing; displaying irritability, aggression, or abusive behaviour when gadgets are taken away are some behavioural changes parents spot.\nEmotional indicators: Mood swings or being unusually secretive can be one of the major emotional indicators, social withdrawal or isolation and even decline in academic performance can be usual warning signs for parents.\nPhysical and routine changes: Spending more time on mobile phones, often secretly, sleep disturbances or complaints of headaches can also be considered as primary warning signs.\nGeneral observation: Any noticeable change in a child’s behavior typically has a reason, and in today’s context, it often stems from online activity.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRole of communication between parents and kids:\nShivalkar believes that parents should become role models for kids. “Parents should set good examples. If they use their smartphones all the time, then they cannot talk to kids about their ill effects. There is a need for conscious parenting. And, parents must be more alert, educated, and aware than the kids,” she said. “Parents should encourage kids to indulge in alternative hobbies such as arts and sports.”\n“Parents need to develop the art of holding conversations while keeping their child’s comfort in mind. These conversations need not be limited to online safety but can also include topics like sexuality, drug use, and education,” says Kumar. The online safety expert asserts that before giving a child access to a device or Wi-Fi network, parents should understand its purpose and be informed about the apps their child uses.\nAlso Read | Is your child addicted to smartphones? Psychologist shares 7 reasons to be concerned\n“Avoid installing apps unless you know what they do, who uses them, and the type of interactions they allow. Simply following trends is unsafe. A quick search, such as the app’s name followed by ‘child safety,’ can provide useful details about the app and its security features. Once your child is online, engage them in conversations about their activities—for example, ask what games they play or how things are going,” said Kumar, adding that the earlier parents intervene, less harm is likely to occur.\n“For kids under 8 years of age, the conversations should be around what they see on the internet, teaching them not to share personal details online, and avoiding interactions with strangers. For pre-teens, the discussion should focus on the significance of privacy settings on apps, digital footprint, and the importance of avoiding inappropriate content,” said Hardas. \nADVERTISEMENT\nCommunication is key to keeping your child safe online. (Image: FreePik)\nHardas says recognising cyberbullying, reporting it and informing parents should be encouraged among children. She emphasised that there is no need to instill fear in their children about the internet.\nWhat about a child’s privacy?\nIn an ideal world, parents should respect their child’s privacy online. However, this respect should be balanced with appropriate guidance and supervision to ensure they are safe.\nKumar strongly feels that respecting a child’s privacy is a foreign concept created by big tech companies. “A child’s privacy can be secondary to their safety. Till the age of 18, it is parents, school, and society that are responsible for the child’s safety,” he said, highlighting that it is completely on the parent to keep their child safe.\nShivalkar too feels that parents are afraid to infiltrate the privacy of their kids. But up to 18 years, all screen content needs to be monitored by parents. On the other hand, Kumar notes that parental controls are effective. \nADVERTISEMENT\nAlso Read | Your smartphone is frying your brain: Neuroscientist explains how increased screen time is impacting our lives\n“Most platforms and apps have the option of parental controls. Parents can also find multiple options to customise the online experience. Instagram has recently launched a new feature where algorithms can be completely reset; this makes sure young ones are only seeing content that is entertaining, educating, and fun for them, and none of the harmful content comes into their timeline if they are using their parents’ phone,” said Kumar. \nWhere to seek help?\nExperts always mention that parents should seek help the moment they feel that something is off, but from where and how are questions. Shivalkar offers a simple answer, “Pediatricians where your kids go since they are born is where you take them once you notice warning signs. Pediatricians all over the country are constantly trained to deal with these issues. And taking children to them is less of a task, since they are accustomed to the visit from their childhood.\nCan parents seek help from schools?\nYes, experts suggest that schools can be approached for further help. “In certain cases, children tend to follow things taught in school more and hence parents should ask for awareness activities from school in cases of online safety, schools can play a better role,” Shivalkar said.\n“Schools play a very important role, education and capacity building should come from schools. Parents need to make sure that children are made aware of online safety through schools,” Ami said. \nGeneral guidelines for parents:\nExperts recommend the following tips to help parents keep their children safe online:\n📌Practise open and unbiased communication with your children.\n📌Follow screen time guidelines recommended by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics.\n📌Be firm in saying “no” to gadgets, even if children use emotional tactics.\n📌Lead by example and limit your gadget use at home.\n📌Watch for early signs of screen addiction.\n📌Seek help from a pediatrician or child psychologist if needed."

        "content": "Few fabrics rival the storied elegance of chiffon. Light, ethereal, and timeless, it has adorned queens and commoners alike, cementing its place as a symbol of grace. Among its most iconic champions was Maharani Gayatri Devi of Jaipur, whose effortless style elevated chiffon saris to royal couture. Inspired by her mother, Maharani Indira Devi of Cooch Behar, Gayatri Devi commissioned exquisite French chiffon saris, making them synonymous with understated luxury.\n“Chiffon saris are the epitome of effortless elegance,” said Rohini Singh of Just Chiffons, a Jaipur-based label inspired by the personal styling preferences of India’s royalty. “My mother began making chiffon saris to preserve the charm of pure silk chiffon, which was otherwise hard to find, and that’s how our label was born,” she said.\nInspired by her mother, Gayatri Devi popularised the fabric, commissioning yards of French chiffon to create saris that became synonymous with understated luxury. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)\nFrom ancient China to French haute couture and India’s regal courts, chiffon’s legacy is a journey through time and culture. Today, chiffon continues to enchant, weaving together centuries of craftsmanship, cultural evolution, and enduring beauty.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe origins of chiffon: From aristocracy to couture\nChiffon originated in ancient China as a luxurious silk fabric reserved for the elite. Its journey to Europe in the 1700s brought it into the hearts of French fashion, where it earned its name from the French word chiffe, meaning rag. But this name belied its opulence—chiffon was anything but common.\n“Chiffon has always been synonymous with affluence,” said Mainak Dey, assistant professor of textile design at Pearl Academy. “It was first embraced by European nobility for its delicate texture and was later transformed into a global fashion statement.”\nBy the 19th century, chiffon became a favourite of high couture, celebrated for its ability to drape effortlessly and its semi-transparent quality that added mystique to every garment.\nKareena Kapoor Khan in a chiffon sari from Atelier Shikaarbagh\nThe art of making chiffon\nAt its heart, chiffon is a weave rather than a material. Made using tightly twisted yarns—S-twist and Z-twist—it creates a subtle crinkle that defines its texture. The original chiffon, Mousseline de Soie, was crafted entirely from silk. The process was intricate, with threads spun and woven to achieve a fabric so delicate it seemed almost weightless.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Handwoven silk chiffon is a rarity today,” said Maayankraj Singh of Atelier Shikaarbagh. “Modern mechanisation has replaced traditional methods, but producing authentic chiffon still takes time—up to seven or eight days for a single bale.”\nSynthetic chiffon, made from polyester or nylon, emerged in the mid-20th century as a cheaper alternative. Though quicker to produce, it lacks the softness and breathability of natural silk chiffon. Designer Jaykirti Singh explains, “Synthetic fibres are extruded and woven in a plain weave to mimic chiffon’s texture, but they don’t carry the same tactile luxury.”\nChiffon’s Indian Legacy\nChiffon’s entry into India is steeped in royal history. Maharani Indira Devi of Cooch Behar, impressed by the fabric during her travels in France, envisioned its light, flowing quality as perfect for saris. Her commissions led to the adaptation of chiffon into traditional Indian attire, setting a trend embraced by her daughter, Maharani Gayatri Devi.\nThe then Maharani Gayatri Devi in her trademark chiffon sari (Express archive)\n“It’s fascinating to think how a single fabric could influence an entire aesthetic,” said Rohini.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDifferentiating real from synthetic chiffon\nIn a market flooded with imitations, recognising authentic chiffon is essential. Silk chiffon is soft, luxurious, and has a delicate sheen, while synthetic versions often feel plastic-like and overly shiny.\nALSO READ | From festive finery to generational hand-me-downs, how the delicate jamdani is making a comeback\n“A simple burn test can tell you the truth,” said Dey. “Silk chiffon smells like burnt hair and leaves brittle ash, while synthetics melt and emit a chemical odour.” “Price is another indicator—genuine silk chiffon is way more expensive,” said Rohini.\nChiffon’s evolution and need for revival\nChiffon has adapted to the times, from its origins in silk to its widespread use in synthetic blends. Its versatility has made it a favorite for saris, gowns, lingerie, and even home décor. However, this evolution raises concerns about sustainability.\nJanhvi Kapoor in a chiffon sari from Atelier Shikaarbagh\n“Polyester chiffon may be economical, but it’s not biodegradable. Revitalising chiffon involves promoting organic silk and recycled fibres while preserving traditional weaving techniques,” said Dey.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMaayankraj stressed the role of consumers: “Investing in authentic chiffon supports artisans and keeps this legacy alive. A pure chiffon sari is not just a purchase—it’s a tribute to centuries of craftsmanship.”\nBy embracing authentic chiffon, we ensure its story continues to flow—light as air, enduring as time itself.\n📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram"

        "content": "The Telangana IAS Officers’ Institute and the Telangana IPS Officers’ Association have condemned remarks made by Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS) working president and MLA from Sircilla, K T Rama Rao, against Rajanna Sircilla District Collector Sandeep Kumar Jha.\nOn November 26, Rao had accused the District Collector of behaving like a Congress worker and urging BRS activists to join Congress.\n“The District Collector is working as a Congress party worker. Don’t be afraid of such people. Even Chief Minister Revanth Reddy cannot do anything to BRS. District Collectors and other officers who are working as Congress activists would be taught a good lesson when BRS returns to power,” Rao had said while addressing party workers in his home constituency.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“It is disturbing to note that it is becoming a norm to cast aspersions on public servants by persons occupying responsible public offices,” the IAS Officers’ Institute said in a statement.\nThe Telangana IAS Officers’ Association also expressed “deep concern and strong condemnation regarding the recent derogatory statement” by Rao.\n“In an unfortunate public remark, the collector was personally targeted and belittled in a manner that undermines the dignity of the officer holding such an important position in the state’s administration and Civil Services at large. We demand that such statements are retracted and an apology for the unwarranted remarks made,” the statement said.\nThe Association said that Rao’s comments questioned Jha’s integrity and impartiality. “The Association calls for immediate cessation of such unfounded accusations and urges all stakeholders to engage in discourse that respects institutional integrity and the rule of law,” it said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nKTR, who was a minister when the BRS was in power, has had several run-ins with the ruling Congress since the latter stormed to power in November 2023.\nEarlier this month, Rao alleged that Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy’s brother-in-law was awarded contracts worth over Rs 1,000 crore under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) despite his company lacking the necessary qualifications."

        "content": "The Odisha government has decided to enact a new law with stringent penal provisions to check cheating and other discrepancies in public examinations conducted by various recruitment agencies of the state.\nOfficials said the proposed law would be aimed at effectively and legally deterring persons, organised groups, or institutions that indulge in various unfair means and adversely impact the public examination systems for monetary or wrongful gains. Currently, there is no specific law in Odisha to prevent cheating in examinations.\nThe government plans to pass the law — known as the Odisha Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024 — in the ongoing session of the state assembly.\nOffences under the purview of the law\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to the proposed law, actions such as leaking question papers, providing solutions to questions by unauthorised persons during the examination, and tempering with answer sheets or any documents for shortlisting candidates are offences. Violation of security measures to facilitate unfair means, tempering with computer networks or systems, manipulation in seating arrangements, and creation of fake websites to cheat or for monetary gain are also offences.\nThe law says it is an offence for the service provider to hold examinations in alternative premises without the written approval of the public examination authorities.\nPunishment for offences\nAll offences under the new law will be cognisable, non-bailable and non-compoundable. Any person resorting to unfair means and offences under this law will be punished with imprisonment for a term not less than three years which may extend to five years and with a fine of up to ten lakh rupees.\nThe service provider shall also be liable to be punished with the imposition of a fine up to Rs 1 crore while there is also a provision to recover the proportionate cost of examination from the service provider. In such a case, it would be barred from being assigned with any responsibility for the conduct of any public examination for four years.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIf the director, senior management or the persons in charge of the service provider firm found of committed any offence under the law, they will be liable for imprisonment for a term not less than three years which may extend to ten years and with a fine of Rs 1 crore.\nSimilarly, if a person or group of persons including the examination authority or any other institution commits an organised crime, they will be punished with imprisonment for a term not less than five years, which may extend up to ten years and with a fine of not less than Rs 1 crore. If an institution is involved in committing an organised crime, its property shall be subjected to attachment and forfeiture and the proportionate cost of examination shall also be recovered from it.\nAn officer not below the rank of deputy superintendent of police (DSP) or assistant commissioner of police (ACP) can only investigate the offences under this proposed law.\nAlso in explained | Why is there controversy around NEET this year?\nWhy the law is needed\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn October, hundreds of job seekers in Odisha staged protests demanding the cancellation of online examinations conducted by various public examination authorities for recruitment to posts such as revenue inspectors, Amin, ICDS supervisors and statistical officers citing massive discrepancies in the way the exams were conducted.\nRecently, there were allegations about examinations being conducted in various cyber cafes and small computer centres in shopping malls without proper security arrangements. Last year, the Odisha Staff Selection Commission had to cancel and reschedule the examination for recruitment to fill a total of 1,225 vacancies of which 1,008 are for the post of junior engineer (civil) and the remaining 217 are for the assistant training officer following question paper leak."

We hope and trust that the trial court will not proceed with the matter till the matter is listed before the high court and any further proceedings will be in terms of the order passed,” the Supreme Court order said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe bench also said that “in case any revision/appeal/miscellaneous petition is preferred before the appropriate forum, the same would be listed within a period of 3 working days after the same is filed”.\nThe court said that “in the meanwhile, peace and harmony must be maintained” and recorded the assurance of Additional Solicitor General (ASG) K M Nataraj to this effect.

(Express Photo)\nThe Supreme Court said it will keep the appeal pending and hear it again on January 6, 2025. The bench also clarified that it has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the matter.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe appeal contended that the mosque had been in existence since the 16th century and has been in continuous use by Muslims as a place of worship but the matter was rushed through in “hot haste” after a suit was filed by eight plaintiffs who alleged that it was built after destroying the ‘Shri Hari Har Temple’.\nThe suit was presented on November 19, and on the same day, the trial court, in an ex-parte order, allowed the request for appointing an advocate commissioner for a survey of the mosque, the plea said. It added that the order gave no reasons as to why the application was being considered ex-parte and why it was allowed. The court also gave no reasons nor any terms of reference for the survey, it pointed out.\nAlso Read | How Sambhal row was born, post 1878 suit dismissal, post 1976 tension, when a priest met some familiar names\nThe mosque management said that within two hours of the order, the advocate commissioner, along with the plaintiffs’ advocates and police force, arrived at the mosque to conduct the survey which started at 6 pm and continued until 8.30 pm.\nThe team arrived for a second survey on the morning of November 24 and asked worshippers, who were present in the mosque for dawn prayers, to leave the premises, it said. The plea added: “The hot haste in which the matter proceeded and a subsequent survey was suddenly conducted, gave rise to apprehensions in the mind of the residents of the area, which brought them outside their house.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nViolence broke out after the survey team showed up at the mosque and four people died of gunshot wounds. The police, however, claimed the bullets were not fired by them."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/dmk-govt-labelled-central-scheme-casteist-9697233/?ref=hometop_hp",
        "content": "The Tamil Nadu government has rejected the implementation of the PM Vishwakarma Central scheme, launched in 2023. In a letter, dated November 27, addressed to Union Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) Jitan Ram Manjhi, Chief Minister M K Stalin said Tamil Nadu will have its own scheme that is more “inclusive” and does not “discriminate on the basis of caste”.\nA day later, on Thursday, Tamil Nadu MP and Stalin’s sister K Kanimozhi reiterated to the media in New Delhi that the DMK-led government had rejected the scheme. “The scheme resurrects caste and clan systems in which children should take up the profession of their parents. We cannot accept it,” she said.\nWhat is the Vishwakarma scheme?\nLaunched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September 2023, the Vishwakarma scheme is aimed at providing “end-to-end support for artisans and craftspeople who work with their hands and tools”. The scheme covers artisans engaged in 18 trades, from carpentry, sculpture and boat making to pottery, toy making and tailoring.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe stated benefits of the scheme include recognition of artisans through ID cards and skill upgradation through training programmes that extends from five to 15 days with a daily stipend of Rs 500. The beneficiaries are also eligible for a Rs 15,000 incentive to buy tools, and loans of up to Rs 3 lakh at a concessional interest rate of 5%. The scheme also provides for a digital transaction incentive of Re 1 per transaction for up to 100 transactions, which will be directly credited to the account of the beneficiary. As per the scheme, marketing support will also be provided to the artisans.\nWhy is it facing criticism?\nThe scheme, however, has drawn criticism for a mandatory clause included in its implementation.\nAs per the scheme, every applicant should declare that his or her profession or trade is “a family profession acquired through guru-shishya tradition”. Meaning, only those who have taken up the profession of their parents or family alone will be beneficiaries of the scheme.\n“As per clause 14 of the application manual, the scheme requires that artisans should have acquired the craft from their parents or relatives through an unpaid apprenticeship or guru-shishya apprenticeship. Such unpaid labour is mandated by the caste system, where certain professions are linked only to certain castes and are perpetuated by family ties,” DMK spokesperson Saravanan Annadurai told The Indian Express.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAlso Read | Decode Politics: Why Sanjay Raut is blaming ex-CJI Chandrachud for MVA’s poll debacle\nHow has the Tamil Nadu government opposed the scheme?\nIn a letter addressed to the PM on January 4 this year, CM Stalin asked for three modifications to the scheme.\nFirstly, the letter argued that “the mandatory need for the applicant’s family to be traditionally engaged in a family-based traditional trade be removed” and suggested that “any person pursuing any of the occupations listed in the guidelines should be eligible for assistance under the scheme”.\nStalin also asked for the minimum age criterion to be changed from 18 to 35 years. “The minimum age criterion can be increased to 35 years so that only those who have made an informed choice to continue their family trade can avail of benefits under this scheme”.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe CM also wrote that the state government wanted beneficiaries to be verified by a Village Administrative Officer of the Revenue Department instead of the head of the Gram Panchayat.\nWhile Manjhi replied to this letter in March 2024, no modifications were made to the scheme, according to the state government. “As the modifications were not accepted by the Union government, the government of Tamil Nadu decided not to implement the scheme,” Annadurai said.\nWhat does the state government plan to do instead?\nAs per Stalin’s November 27 letter to Manjhi, Tamil Nadu will implement another scheme to “empower artisans… under the overall principle of social justice”.\nThis scheme, which is yet to be launched by the state government, will be “a more inclusive and comprehensive scheme for artisans, which does not discriminate based on caste”, as per the letter.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Centre, however, is yet to respond to this latest letter.\nHave Tamil Nadu and the Centre clashed in the past?\nThe Vishwakarma scheme is not the only issue of contention between the DMK-led state government and the BJP-led Centre.\nTamil Nadu, with the history of its Dravidian movement, has long been opposed to what it views as the “imposition of Hindi”. In 2022, Stalin wrote to Modi stating the imposition of Hindi was both “impractical and divisive”. This was in response to a parliamentary panel’s recommendation that the medium of instruction in national institutes, including Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in Hindi-speaking states should be Hindi. But, Stalin pointed out, such institutions enrol students from across the country.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Tamil Nadu government had also sought an exemption for its students from the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), calling the exam discriminatory towards rural students who cannot afford coaching classes.\nThe Tamil Nadu government has also opposed the Centre’s “discrimination” against southern states in devolution of taxes. According to the state government, the Centre has been devolving less in taxes to the southern states, including Tamil Nadu, for “performing better” financially.\nIn the long list of Tamil Nadu’s tiffs with the Centre, there is also the stand-off between the state government and Governor R N Ravi. According to Stalin’s government, Ravi has not cleared several Bills passed by the state Assembly."

        "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/australia-ban-social-media-kids-under-16-psychologist-benefits-9697072/?ref=latestnews_hp",
        "content": "Australia is taking a bold step in child safety by introducing a social media ban for children under 16. By restricting access until children are 16, the goal is to foster healthier online habits, encourage more face-to-face interactions, and reduce exposure to harmful content.\nThe move has received mixed reactions. Supporters argue that it prioritises child well-being, while critics question how effectively such a ban can be enforced and its impact on children’s ability to learn digital literacy skills.\nCounselling psychologist Srishti Vatsa unequivocally supports the fact that “social media does more harm than good to children at an impressionable age.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nHere’s a breakdown of the effects of social media on different age groups, as explained by Vatsa, and why this ban may be a step in the right direction.\nWhy social media can be harmful for kids\nFor Young Children (Aged 5–8)\nAt this age, the benefits of social media are extremely limited, even with access to educational content.\nAccording to Vatsa, “Children can quickly become addicted to screen time, leading to reduced physical activity and disturbed sleep or eating patterns.” These factors are crucial for healthy growth.\nResearch also suggests that excessive exposure at this age can hinder impulse control, social behaviour, and emotional regulation.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFor Pre-Teens (Aged 9–12)\nPre-teens are at a critical stage of self-discovery, and while social media may offer creative outlets and a way to connect with friends, it also brings increased risks.\nVatsa warns of the dangers of cyberbullying and online predators, especially as children in this age group begin to develop more independence and may hide their online activities from parents. “Unhealthy screen habits can interfere with emotional and social development, putting them at a disadvantage in forming real-world relationships,” she adds.\nBy restricting access until children are 16, the goal is to foster healthier online habits, encourage more face-to-face interactions, and reduce exposure to harmful content. (Image: iStock)\nFor Teenagers (Aged 13–16)\nTeenagers gain the most from social media in terms of social connections and access to supportive communities, especially during their formative years of understanding their bodies and sexuality. However, these benefits often come at a cost.\nVatsa notes that “teens are more susceptible to anxiety, depression, and body image issues, often exacerbated by online relationships and the pressure to maintain a curated digital persona.” Sleep deprivation, another common consequence of excessive screen use, can further harm their mental health and academic performance.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhat parents can do\nVatsa suggests that parents use this ban as an opportunity to instill better offline habits. She recommends:\nEncouraging physical activities and hobbies to reduce screen dependence.\nDiscussing the potential dangers of social media openly.\nSupervising children’s online activities to ensure safe internet use.\nPromoting family time to build stronger connections outside the digital world.\nWhile Australia’s ban may not be a universal solution, it sheds light on the growing need to address the adverse effects of social media on young minds. As Vatsa aptly concludes, “The digital world offers many opportunities, but children need to be guided to ensure it doesn’t do more harm than good.”\n📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram"

        "content": "With regular skipper Rohit Sharma returning to the fold, he is likely to open the innings against Australia in the 2nd Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy in Adelaide. Veteran batter Cheteshwar Pujara, however, feels that due to KL Rahul’s decent form in the 1st Test, the Karnataka batter should continue to open.\n“I think, for some reason if we can carry on with the same batting order, like KL and Yashasvi to open, Rohit could come in at three, and Shubman could come in at five,” Pujara said in a chat with ESPNcricinfo.\n“If Rohit wants to open, KL should bat at No. 3. Nothing later than that. I think he has to bat top of the order, because it suits his game really well. I hope we don’t tinker around with that,” he added.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWith Shubman Gill set to return to the playing XI following his recovery from the thumb injury that ruled him out of the 1st Test, Pujara explains why the batter would be better suited for the No. 5 role.\n“Ideally No. 5 (for Gill). Because it allows him to come in at a time, even if we lose two wickets early, he is someone who can negotiate the new ball. But if he walks in after, say, 25 or 30 overs, he can play his shots. He can play his natural game. And in case we lose the first three wickets early, Gill walks in and saves Rishabh Pant for the old ball,” he said.\n“(Pant) doesn’t have to face the new ball. I wouldn’t want him to walk in to bat when the ball is hard and new,” Pujara added."

        "content": "–Amitendra Kumar\nDespite preparing for months, the last few days’ revision, a positive attitude, and mock tests play an important role before the Common Law Admission Test. CLAT is scheduled to be held on December 1 and aspirants need to gear up with focused and strategic preparation.\nA two-hour pen-and-paper exam in five sections consisting of 120 questions – English, General Knowledge and Current Affairs, Legal Reasoning, Logical Reasoning, and Quantitative Techniques – requires sharp time management and a solid study strategy.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHere’s how to make the most of your remaining days:\nPrioritise High-Weightage Topics\nCandidates are advised to focus on CLAT sections that carry the most weightage of marks, such as legal reasoning and general knowledge, which together account for 50 per cent of the syllabus. Revising familiar topics ensures that your strong areas become scoring zones, which is vital for gaining an edge over the competition.\nREAD | CLAT 2025: Guide to approach current affairs for legal awareness section?\nMock Tests and Practice Papers\nBeing well aware of the CLAT exam format and using time effectively is essential. Take full-length mock tests to review your performance, mark all mistakes, and try to avoid repeated errors to improve accuracy. However, do not overdo these mock tests as they can be tiring too.\nEfficient Revision Strategies\nEffective revision techniques can streamline your CLAT revision process with the help of brief note preparation. Instead of trying to study new material, concentrate on core concepts and priority areas. To reinforce tricky topics, use mind maps or flowcharts to reduce complexity. Address weak areas, but avoid ignoring CLAT sections where you already shine.\nADVERTISEMENT\nGeneral Knowledge and Current Affairs\nIt is crucial to ensure you’re up-to-date on recent events, so review the past nine months’ current affairs. Use online quizzes or summaries for quick revision. Since this section can be a game changer for a candidate’s overall score, dedicating sufficient time to it is crucial.\nREAD | CLAT 2025: What and how to prepare in the last few months\nTime-Saving Techniques and Formulas\nFor quantitative techniques, practice only the key formulae and shortcuts on which questions frequently get asked. Repetition and practice are your friends, but balance is important to maintain confidence.\nPositive attitude\nStudying for CLAT can be mentally draining, so make sure you’re in the best state of mind and body. Drink plenty of water, eat healthy, and sleep for 7-8 hours daily. Simple exercises or even some relaxation techniques can help relieve stress. At the same time, avoid comparing your preparation with others and trust your hard work.\n— The author is the UG Product Head at Career Launcher"

        "content": "Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te will stop over in Hawaii and Guam during his trip to the South Pacific, drawing criticism from China.\nLai is to leave Taiwan on Saturday on a weeklong trip to visit the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau — three diplomatic allies of the self-governed island.\nLai’s office confirmed on Friday that he will make stopovers in the US state of Hawaii and the US territory of Guam.\nUnder pressure from China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, the island has just 12 formal diplomatic allies.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, it retains strong contacts with dozens of other nations, including the US, its main source of diplomatic and military support. Lai’s planned stopovers drew criticism from Beijing.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said if the US wants to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, it is important for it to handle the issue “with utmost caution, clearly opposing Taiwan independence and supporting China’s peaceful reunification.”\nMao said China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the US and Taiwan, and visits by the latter’s leaders to the US for any reason.\nWhen his predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen, began a stopover in the US on her way to Central America last year, China said it was closely watching and would “resolutely safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Chinese military also launched drills around Taiwan last year as a “stern warning” over what it called collusion between “separatists and foreign forces” days after Lai, then Taiwan’s vice president, stopped over in the US.\nChina objects strongly to such US stopovers by Taiwanese leaders, as well as visits to the island by leading American politicians, terming them violations of the US commitment not to afford diplomatic status to Taiwan after Washington switched its formal recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.\nWith the number of its diplomatic partners declining under Chinese pressure, Taiwan has redoubled efforts to participate in international forums, even from the sidelines."

This came as a surprise because it was thought that the consignment was not meant for India. We are trying to find out why they fed the coordinates of these two places in Andaman,” DGP Hargobinder Singh Dhaliwal told PTI.\nIt is under investigation whether they had plans to unload a portion of the consignment in Andaman, he said.\nDhaliwal said, “Apart from making calls to people in South East Asian countries, the smugglers also contacted a person in North India. We have alerted the agencies concerned and are looking into details about this person.” As part of the investigation, the police are trying to find out who bought the Starlink internet device the smugglers were using mid-sea, and when and its usage history, he said.\nStarlink, a service provided by SpaceX — the aerospace company founded by Elon Musk — is an international telecommunications provider offering coverage in over 100 countries, but not in India.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAt present, the arrested foreign smugglers are in police custody.\nOn November 23, a pilot from the Coast Guard Dornier aircraft, while on routine patrolling, noticed suspicious movement of a fishing trawler near Barren Island, approximately 150 km from Port Blair.\nThe trawler was warned to slow down, and the pilot alerted the Andaman and Nicobar Command. A nearby fast-patrolling vessel then responded and towed the trawler to Port Blair on November 24 for further investigation.\nAuthorities suspect that the drug consignments may be linked to notorious international cartels, such as Tse Chi Lop’s (the Chinese El Chapo) or Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes’ (El Mencho) operations."

But if we lead inactive lives, then that loss accelerates, making us prone to all sorts of diseases.\nThis has been proven by a recent research in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, which shows a massive decline in muscle strength and size among sedentary subjects, aged 60 and above, compared to active ones. From the third decade of life, muscle strength and mass dropped dramatically for sedentary individuals as opposed to active individuals (defined as at least 150 minutes of activity per week) across one’s lifespan. This means half of the strength and size from the peak of the third decade of life to the sixth decade of life is lost for sedentary individuals, affecting their daily activities and making them vulnerable to chronic diseases. Active individuals, on the other hand, retained almost all of their physical function even in their ninth decade of life.
